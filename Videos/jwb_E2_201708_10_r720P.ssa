Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.43,0:00:20.54,Default,,0,0,0,,His motive was good; \Nit was from the heart. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.54,0:00:24.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And when we study David’s life, \Nwe realize that it was a constant. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.49,0:00:43.56,Default,,0,0,0,,it starts out \Nas we have already considered: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.63,0:00:47.23,Default,,0,0,0,,But then it says: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.27,0:00:57.31,Default,,0,0,0,,More directly said, really, it’s: \NJehovah is good. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.52,0:01:15.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Even the elimination of the wicked,\Nreally, is good  \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.49,0:01:19.33,Default,,0,0,0,,because it shows love for those \Nwho just want to live in peace \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.84,0:01:35.21,Default,,0,0,0,,And as we know, \NJehovah looks at more \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.60,0:01:57.43,Default,,0,0,0,,but the scripture says \Nhe didn’t look with approval \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.43,0:02:00.07,Default,,0,0,0,,on Cain and his sacrifice,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.07,0:02:04.37,Default,,0,0,0,, but on Cain, because Cain, \Nevidently, had a bad attitude. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.37,0:02:07.14,Default,,0,0,0,,There was something wrong \Nin his motive\N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.55,0:02:15.29,Default,,0,0,0,,And this ties in with what Amos \Nwrote about the Jews in his day. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.00,0:02:34.04,Default,,0,0,0,,during the time of Amos. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.04,0:02:36.27,Default,,0,0,0,,Verse 21: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.27,0:02:41.28,Default,,0,0,0,,“I hate, \NI despise your festivals, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.68,0:02:48.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps it was incense, \Nwhatever it may have been. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.48,0:02:50.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Then he says in verse 22: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.81,0:03:14.91,Default,,0,0,0,,It has more to do with the attitude \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.82,0:03:22.65,Default,,0,0,0,,And then what’s interesting \Nis the way verse 23 \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.65,0:03:25.32,Default,,0,0,0,,expresses the feelings of Jehovah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.32,0:03:29.06,Default,,0,0,0,,He says: \N“Spare me the din of your songs; \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.62,0:03:56.42,Default,,0,0,0,,And it was apparently loud\N—the music that they played, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.42,0:04:00.49,Default,,0,0,0,,the din of their songs, \Ntheir musical instruments. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.49,0:04:03.89,Default,,0,0,0,,And The Watchtower made \Nan interesting comment on this. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.97,0:04:52.98,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is the point it made: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.64,0:05:24.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, this is what scholar E. P. Sanders \Nhas to say about it\N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.00,0:05:53.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And then the article \Ngoes on to say the following: \N
