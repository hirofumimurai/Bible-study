Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.23,0:00:08.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I lived in the north, \Nwith the glorious dark, starlit sky 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.61,0:00:10.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and the beauty of fir trees. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.70,0:00:13.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I thought it was \Nthe most wonderful place in the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.16,0:00:16.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎My mom was always drawing \Nmy attention to the beauty of creation. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.00,0:00:19.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And she always told me, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.21,0:00:22.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“My daughter, it’s so important \Nto live your life in the right way.”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.21,0:00:24.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And the questions \Nthat stayed with me were:
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.21,0:00:26.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘So why are we alive? 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.55,0:00:30.43,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Why is there so much \Nsuffering, injustice, pain?’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.43,0:00:33.47,Default,,0,0,0,,‎When I was 18, \NI took up a form of karate 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.47,0:00:35.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎known as Kyokushinkai. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.68,0:00:41.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Just imagine a large number \Nof people in kimonos, standing in rows 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.02,0:00:43.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎bravely and without a shadow of fear, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.11,0:00:46.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎working on improving their blows \Nand striving to progress. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.07,0:00:49.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I thought: ‘This is it! \NThis is what I’ve been looking for!’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.36,0:00:51.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I set the goal of reaching \Nthe next world championships, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.91,0:00:53.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎winning a high place, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.91,0:00:56.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and immortalizing myself \Nso that my name would remain 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.79,0:00:58.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and generations would remember me. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.42,0:01:06.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Among those sportsmen, although I saw \Na lot of nice words and slogans, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.59,0:01:09.43,Default,,0,0,0,,‎not everything was \Nas pure as I’d hoped for. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.68,0:01:14.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And then on one occasion, \NI was sitting down 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.43,0:01:17.43,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and feelings of emptiness 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.43,0:01:20.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎just wouldn’t leave me alone. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.18,0:01:22.47,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And for the first time in my life, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.48,0:01:24.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I talked to God. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.48,0:01:26.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And then I prayed: 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.52,0:01:29.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I don’t understand you. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.23,0:01:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Why is there \Nso much beauty in the world 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.82,0:01:35.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and yet so much suffering? 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.37,0:01:38.50,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Is that really what you want 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.49,0:01:40.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—for us to live like this?” 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.16,0:01:43.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I prayed, I guess, \Nfor about four hours. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.46,0:01:46.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎You know, the strongest feeling \Nof emptiness and loneliness 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.46,0:01:50.09,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is that of a creation 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.09,0:01:51.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎without its Creator. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.67,0:01:54.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And I was so lonely at that time. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.43,0:02:00.39,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And a while afterwards, \Nthere was a knock at my door. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.39,0:02:04.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It was Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.52,0:02:08.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I started studying the Bible. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.07,0:02:09.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It was so wonderful! 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.65,0:02:14.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎On one occasion, \Nthe sister who studied with me 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.66,0:02:16.66,Default,,0,0,0,,‎looked up at me, \Nand when she looked at those bruises 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.74,0:02:19.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and those beaten-up knuckles, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.25,0:02:24.25,Default,,0,0,0,,‎she took a deep breath \Nand shook her head. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.25,0:02:25.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I said, “Is there something wrong?” 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.96,0:02:29.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎She said, \N“You know, I’m in great pain.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.59,0:02:32.47,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I said, “Why are you in pain?” 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.46,0:02:33.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎She said: “Well, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.59,0:02:36.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I’m looking at \Nyour hands, your elbows,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.14,0:02:38.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“your battered legs, all of that. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.01,0:02:41.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Doesn’t it hurt?” 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.22,0:02:43.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I said, “Well, yes.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.93,0:02:48.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And she said, “You know, \Nit hurts me to see you in pain.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.65,0:02:52.28,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And I started to understand \Nthat Jehovah is the true God 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.28,0:02:54.62,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and that this really was the truth. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.53,0:02:57.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It was difficult. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.16,0:03:01.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The pressure from relatives \Nand friends was very strong. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.12,0:03:03.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But the most difficult thing 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.20,0:03:06.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that I had to battle with \Nwas my strong attachment to karate. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.71,0:03:10.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Just a year remained \Nuntil the world championships. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.21,0:03:11.84,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I had prepared for them. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.84,0:03:16.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I had been working \Ntoward that goal for five years. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.13,0:03:19.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Glory can seem really sweet 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.05,0:03:23.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎when you are the victor, \Nwhen your opponents fall to the ground. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.10,0:03:29.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So I flew to the world championships. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.90,0:03:32.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎When I made it to the last four winners 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.40,0:03:35.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and I had to fight for third place, 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.40,0:03:37.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I wanted to ask my trainer \Nto let me stop. Why? 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.61,0:03:41.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Because I couldn’t feel \Na single place on my body 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.70,0:03:43.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—everything was beaten up. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.54,0:03:44.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But he said: 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.87,0:03:48.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“You know, we love you so much. \NGo for it!”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.79,0:03:52.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And at that moment, \Nit felt as though I was weighing love 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.67,0:03:54.13,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—the world’s love 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.13,0:03:56.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and the love of Jehovah’s organization. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.63,0:03:59.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It seemed to me \Nthat the world was saying: 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.05,0:04:02.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“We love you. \NNow just go and die!”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.64,0:04:05.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But the love in the organization says, 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.14,0:04:07.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“It hurts me to see you in pain.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.35,0:04:11.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I realized that the world \Ncan’t give you what it doesn’t have. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.73,0:04:13.98,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It doesn’t know how to love. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.98,0:04:15.98,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But, nevertheless, I went to the fight 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.98,0:04:18.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and became the bronze medalist. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.61,0:04:24.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And when I stood \Non the podium of glory, 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.16,0:04:28.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I understood that glory \Namong people who don’t love you 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.29,0:04:30.50,Default,,0,0,0,,‎weighs no more than emptiness. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.58,0:04:34.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎If a person dedicates his life 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.00,0:04:36.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to glorifying himself,\Nhe will always meet 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.42,0:04:39.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎with disappointment and emptiness.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.22,0:04:42.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So I made the firm decision \Nto escape from karate. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.55,0:04:45.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I started preaching, \Nand I was baptized in 2005 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.60,0:04:48.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎at the summer convention in Kurgan. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.98,0:04:53.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Later, I started full-time service. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.06,0:04:57.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I learned the Tatar language \Nso that I could serve in that territory.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.24,0:05:01.24,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, when in the evenings 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.24,0:05:05.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I look up at the starry sky, \NI feel not hopelessness, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.28,0:05:07.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but tremendous joy 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.54,0:05:10.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎because I know who is behind it all: 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.75,0:05:25.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎our loving Creator, Jehovah God.
