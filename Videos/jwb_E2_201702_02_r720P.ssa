Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.92,0:00:39.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, have you ever thought \Nabout why Jehovah gave us this gift? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.22,0:00:41.99,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, \Nwhy trust us with free will \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.83,0:02:28.87,Default,,0,0,0,,But love of God \Nand love of neighbor \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.04,0:02:39.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, to stay \Nwithin those boundaries, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.04,0:02:41.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah gave us \Na marvelous brain \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.45,0:03:22.55,Default,,0,0,0,,So in review so far: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.42,0:03:31.86,Default,,0,0,0,,and he also gave us \NBible principles \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.80,0:03:40.34,Default,,0,0,0,,But making difficult decisions \Nrequires that we train ourselves \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.67,0:03:48.91,Default,,0,0,0,,Now let’s read Romans 12:1, \N
