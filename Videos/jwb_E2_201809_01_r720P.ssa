Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.57,0:03:13.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I was praying to Jehovah \Nto remember me in the resurrection.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.54,0:03:18.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎About that time, several women \Nran out of the houses on both sides of us:

Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.14,0:03:44.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It has three keyboards.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.14,0:03:46.84,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And he said: “And it will take you \Nabout two years to learn it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.84,0:03:48.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Are you willing to accept it?”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.31,0:03:50.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And I said, “Yes, I will.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.41,0:03:52.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So I was put on the Linotype.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.65,0:03:57.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I got married \Nin the fall of 1945 and left Bethel.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.92,0:04:01.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, we were invited in 1949
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.32,0:04:03.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to go into the circuit work.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.33,0:04:05.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We were in the 21st class of Gilead.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.33,0:04:07.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We enjoyed that course very much.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.36,0:04:09.80,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We received an assignment for Cuba,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.80,0:04:12.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and I was assigned as branch overseer.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.87,0:04:16.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And in ’63,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.34,0:04:19.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the police car came
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.54,0:04:21.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎up to the branch \Nat about ten o’clock at night.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.71,0:04:23.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I was told to take my papers,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.38,0:04:26.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and we went \Nover to the police station, and so forth.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.78,0:04:30.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And sure enough, \Nsoon thereafter, here comes an official.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.59,0:04:32.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He said, “You have to leave Cuba
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.59,0:04:36.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎because you’re not in favor \Nof the Cuban government.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.33,0:04:41.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎A person asked \Na policeman standing close by, he said,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.06,0:04:44.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Who are these people \Nthat are being sent out of the country?”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.63,0:04:46.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And they said: “Over there,”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.04,0:04:48.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎talking about me,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.57,0:04:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“see that gangster man over there?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.57,0:04:52.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He’s the head of it.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.91,0:04:55.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So then we got on the plane \Nand headed back.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.48,0:04:58.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I got in contact with Brooklyn Bethel,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.18,0:05:00.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎talked to Brother Knorr, and he said,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.18,0:05:03.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“As soon as you can, \Nin the next day or two, come back to Bethel.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.39,0:05:06.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And Brother Knorr said, \N“You got back just in time
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.19,0:05:08.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“to get back on the Linotype machine
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.36,0:05:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to set up a new book we have in Spanish.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.00,0:05:13.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So I did that and got on the Linotype.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.63,0:05:18.77,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And then Brother Knorr told me, he said,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.77,0:05:21.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“In 1964, we’re going to have \Na ten-month course in Gilead
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.87,0:05:26.04,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for all branch people \Nwho have branch experience.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.04,0:05:28.24,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Oh, it was very, very good.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.24,0:05:30.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We studied a lot, not only the Bible
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.78,0:05:33.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎(we studied a lot on the Bible, \Ndiscourse and everything)
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.75,0:05:38.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but we studied a lot of branch material too.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.45,0:05:42.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Above everything else, \Nour love for Jehovah should continue to grow.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.46,0:05:46.13,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He knows our thoughts, our mind, our heart.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.13,0:05:48.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He goes far beyond what man can do.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.70,0:05:50.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And whatever his decision is,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.37,0:05:54.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I’ve learned to understand \Nthat it’s the best decision.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.54,0:05:59.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I have learned that if we obey \Nwhat the organization says
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.08,0:06:02.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and what the Bible says, \Nthen we’re doing Jehovah’s will;
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.11,0:06:03.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and that’s my concern
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.81,0:06:08.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—no regrets whatsoever, none.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.79,0:06:10.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Maybe I could’ve done more at times,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.99,0:06:13.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but I’m certainly glad \Nthat I have taken advantage of it
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.62,0:06:15.62,Default,,0,0,0,,‎as much as I have up until now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.63,0:06:17.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And it’s been a happy life.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.73,0:06:20.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And I have seen Jehovah’s hand
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.10,0:06:23.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎time and again.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.63,0:06:29.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Brother Goff has led \Na full, happy life in theocratic service. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.64,0:06:31.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But do you wonder,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.67,0:06:34.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘How was he \Nable to persevere for so many years
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.41,0:06:37.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and through so many different assignments?’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.41,0:06:39.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Cecil learned the value
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.52,0:06:41.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of letting Jehovah and his organization
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.85,0:06:44.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎shape his thinking. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.19,0:06:46.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But he had to make \Na choice as a young man,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.99,0:06:50.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎a choice all of Jehovah’s servants \Nhave to make. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.06,0:06:54.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And that’s the basis \Nfor our discussion this month. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.06,0:06:56.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The theme is
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.10,0:06:59.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Stop Being Molded \Nby This System of Things.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.87,0:07:01.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In describing godly wisdom,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.87,0:07:03.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the ancient man Job
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.61,0:07:06.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎recognized it as priceless. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.21,0:07:08.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎At Job 28:17, he said:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.61,0:07:12.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Gold and glass cannot be compared to it.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.92,0:07:17.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Glass\N—it has been around for centuries,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.02,0:07:19.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎even back in Job’s day. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.52,0:07:22.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎However, \Nwhat revolutionized glass production
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.43,0:07:25.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎was the invention of glassblowing. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.56,0:07:27.76,Default,,0,0,0,,‎By blowing through a hollow tube,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.76,0:07:32.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎a glassblower can quickly mold \Nsuperheated molten glass
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.10,0:07:34.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎into a specific shape.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.24,0:07:38.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Satan’s system has developed the art
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.61,0:07:41.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of shaping the minds of people
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.04,0:07:45.98,Default,,0,0,0,,‎into fragile glass vessels \Nwith little useful purpose. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.98,0:07:49.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In fact, \NRomans 9:22 refers to such ones
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.89,0:07:54.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎as “vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.89,0:07:59.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Find with me Romans 12:2. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.23,0:08:03.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎What is responsible for molding and shaping
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.17,0:08:06.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the inclinations of the people of the world? 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.30,0:08:08.47,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Romans 12:2:
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.47,0:08:12.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“And stop being molded \Nby this system of things,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.07,0:08:16.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“but be transformed \Nby making your mind over,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.35,0:08:18.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“so that you \Nmay prove to yourselves
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.58,0:08:22.98,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the good and acceptable \Nand perfect will of God.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.29,0:08:26.56,Default,,0,0,0,,‎To counteract “being molded,” \Nthe verse said:
