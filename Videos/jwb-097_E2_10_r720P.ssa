Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.24,0:04:57.41,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, it’s a toll road,

Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.35,0:05:41.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Why do so few people\Nchoose to walk this road?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.16,0:05:43.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Primarily because very few people today
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.89,0:05:48.56,Default,,0,0,0,,want God’s laws and principles\Nto govern their lives.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.56,0:05:51.00,Default,,0,0,0,,True, this road has boundaries,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.00,0:05:54.20,Default,,0,0,0,,but those boundaries help\Nthe ones who walk the road
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.20,0:05:56.24,Default,,0,0,0,,to avoid wrongdoing,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.24,0:05:59.31,Default,,0,0,0,,to fight wrong desires,\Nto resist peer pressure
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.31,0:06:01.91,Default,,0,0,0,,and the fear of ridicule that may come
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.91,0:06:04.31,Default,,0,0,0,,as a result of walking this road.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.72,0:06:09.02,Default,,0,0,0,,The broad road is centered on self
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.02,0:06:12.32,Default,,0,0,0,,—self-indulgence, self-awareness,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.32,0:06:15.92,Default,,0,0,0,,self-fulfillment, and self-interest.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.93,0:06:17.93,Default,,0,0,0,,In contrast,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.93,0:06:21.80,Default,,0,0,0,,this narrow road calls for self-control,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.80,0:06:24.90,Default,,0,0,0,,self-denial, hard work,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.90,0:06:27.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and respect for authority.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.40,0:06:32.14,Default,,0,0,0,,But this is the road to true freedom.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.14,0:06:35.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Interestingly, some scriptures\Nthat talk about the freedom
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.75,0:06:39.92,Default,,0,0,0,,that Jehovah gives may appear to be\Na little bit confusing.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.92,0:06:43.72,Default,,0,0,0,,For example, let’s open\Nto 1 Peter chapter 2
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.72,0:06:45.72,Default,,0,0,0,,and verse16.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.72,0:06:48.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And as we read it, notice
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.72,0:06:52.99,Default,,0,0,0,,the contrasting expressions in this scripture
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.00,0:06:56.47,Default,,0,0,0,,—1 Peter 2:16.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.47,0:06:59.41,Default,,0,0,0,,It says: “Be as free people,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.51,0:07:07.31,Default,,0,0,0,,but as slaves of God.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.31,0:07:11.28,Default,,0,0,0,,How interesting that we can be free
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.28,0:07:14.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and be a slave at the same time!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.02,0:07:18.29,Default,,0,0,0,,For most people, the idea of becoming\Na slave to anyone or anything
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.29,0:07:20.29,Default,,0,0,0,,is not appealing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.29,0:07:23.73,Default,,0,0,0,,However, there are positive aspects

Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.26,0:08:04.56,Default,,0,0,0,,so it gives us a glimpse of what it’s like
