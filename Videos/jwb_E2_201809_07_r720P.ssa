Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.02,0:00:03.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎This morning I thought I’d discuss the matter 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.99,0:00:06.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of how a proper view of discipline 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.46,0:00:09.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎keeps us close to Jehovah. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.03,0:00:11.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, in the context of today’s text 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.39,0:00:12.66,Default,,0,0,0,,‎about Jehovah correcting 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.66,0:00:14.76,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to the proper degree, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.76,0:00:19.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎he’s talking to his people\Nabout being brought back to their land. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.07,0:00:23.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He was not going to exterminate them \Nor leave them, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.34,0:00:26.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and it helps us to appreciate \Nthat he wanted them 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.74,0:00:29.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to keep their relationship with him. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.48,0:00:34.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, today we receive \Ndiscipline in various ways. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.28,0:00:37.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It might be from personal Bible study. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.49,0:00:39.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And I was excited this morning 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.49,0:00:42.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎(I don’t know when it happened, \Nmaybe last night) 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.46,0:00:44.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to see that we have in JW Library® 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.89,0:00:46.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎where we can put our personal notes, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.90,0:00:49.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and I got started with some already. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.53,0:00:53.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So that’ll be like thoughts \Nor discipline from Jehovah 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.17,0:00:56.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that is just between him and ourselves 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.57,0:01:00.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—a very beneficial and wise way \Nto go when it comes to discipline. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.68,0:01:04.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It keeps us from veering off \Nin our relationship with him. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.48,0:01:07.28,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It might be something \Nwe read in a publication; 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.28,0:01:10.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎might hear in a talk at a meeting, \Nat an assembly, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.45,0:01:14.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or convention; \Nsomething in a JW Broadcast 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.29,0:01:19.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—various ways, any number of ways \NJehovah will discipline us. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.30,0:01:21.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And we need to remember 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.87,0:01:25.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that he does it \Nso that we remain close to him. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.14,0:01:29.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The problem is discipline \Nis not easy to take. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.47,0:01:31.47,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It requires humility. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.47,0:01:35.98,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And the proper view of discipline \Nis found here in Proverbs chapter 3, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.71,0:01:41.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and this gives us the Scriptural basis 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.48,0:01:43.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to have this proper view of discipline 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.72,0:01:47.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that’ll keep us close to Jehovah God. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.19,0:01:52.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, notice verses 11 and 12 \Nof Proverbs chapter 3: 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.03,0:01:56.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“My son, do not reject \Nthe discipline of Jehovah, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.20,0:01:58.80,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and do not loathe his reproof, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.80,0:02:02.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“for those whom Jehovah loves \Nhe reproves, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.41,0:02:06.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎just as a father does a son \Nin whom he delights.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.78,0:02:11.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So how might we reject \Nthe discipline of Jehovah? 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.18,0:02:15.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, put yourself \Nin a position of being counseled. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.08,0:02:18.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It’s come to the point \Nwhere overseers and elders 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.66,0:02:21.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎have had to sit down with you. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.22,0:02:24.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, for some, \Nas soon as the counsel begins to flow, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.86,0:02:28.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎there’s this quickness to be upset, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.40,0:02:32.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to justify, to feel picked on. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.07,0:02:35.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, Jehovah is saying, ‘Don’t reject this.’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.64,0:02:39.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎If they’re using the Scriptures \Nand thoughts from publications, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.81,0:02:44.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎view it as coming from Jehovah \Nso that we can stay close to him. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.81,0:02:47.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, to give you an idea, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.68,0:02:52.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎sometimes reading something \Nwill bring us close to Jehovah, 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.36,0:02:55.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎especially if we veered off \Nand didn’t even realize it. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.93,0:02:59.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I’m going to go way back \Nto some examples 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.16,0:03:03.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of Jehovah’s sheep \Nreading something in The Watchtower, 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.63,0:03:08.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and it just disciplined them \Nso that they could get close to Jehovah. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.00,0:03:10.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And it goes way back to 1982, 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.91,0:03:14.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and it had to do with TV serials, \Nor soap operas. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.94,0:03:18.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Some are saying, \N“Well, that’s a long time ago.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.18,0:03:21.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, the fact is nothing has changed. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.02,0:03:24.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Some of these soap operas \Nare still on that had the name 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.99,0:03:26.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that they had in 1982. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.99,0:03:28.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They still have it. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.49,0:03:32.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So many readers \Npersonally benefited from the counsel. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.63,0:03:35.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The counsel still applies \Nthat was found there. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.30,0:03:38.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But I think it’s very touching \Nand commendable 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.10,0:03:42.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for the ones who read that \Nthat they recognized it. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.91,0:03:44.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It impacted their relationship with Jehovah, 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.91,0:03:46.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and they wanted to get close to him. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.91,0:03:50.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, the cover on The Watchtower was 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.01,0:03:52.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“TV Serials—Can They Corrupt the Heart?” 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.95,0:03:56.25,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And in the opening article, we did say: 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.25,0:04:00.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Millions of women and men of all ages, 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.02,0:04:03.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎races and backgrounds \Nwill rarely miss a show.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.36,0:04:08.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, now you can record them \Nand have them anytime that you like. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.10,0:04:12.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It’s still an ongoing problem \Nand an issue for a true Christian, 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.67,0:04:17.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎a worshipper of Jehovah, \Nto make sure we’re not being corrupted 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.14,0:04:20.24,Default,,0,0,0,,‎by soap operas, or TV serials.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.24,0:04:23.24,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, after the articles came out, 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.25,0:04:27.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎we had some write in \Nto explain what happened to them. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.75,0:04:32.76,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And so months later, \Nafter this 1982 issue of The Watchtower 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.76,0:04:35.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎(that was December 1), 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.36,0:04:38.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎we went \Nto the ’83 Watchtower, December 1, 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.83,0:04:41.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and here’s the response \Nfrom some of the readers. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.20,0:04:43.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And I found it very commendable. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.57,0:04:47.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I think you’ll appreciate the humility \Nbecause it takes humility 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.80,0:04:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to accept and have \Nthe proper view of discipline. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.57,0:04:53.24,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So one of the dangers 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.24,0:04:56.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that the brothers \Nwere warned about is that 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.31,0:05:00.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎you can get emotionally attached \Nto the characters in the show. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.65,0:05:03.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So here’s what one wrote: 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.12,0:05:05.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I had grown up \Nwatching this one soap opera 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.89,0:05:10.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and the character ‘Julie’ \Nwas just like my ‘friend.’ . . . 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.03,0:05:12.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“One day ‘Julie’ had an accident 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.60,0:05:16.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“that left her beautiful face \Nbadly scarred . . . 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.40,0:05:19.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I was in front of the TV set every day 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.30,0:05:22.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“to make sure \Nshe was going to pull through. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.61,0:05:26.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“That night as I was saying my prayers, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.34,0:05:28.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“before I even thought \Nwhat I was saying, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.51,0:05:33.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I prayed, \N‘And Jehovah, please bless Julie.’” 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.05,0:05:37.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, she admits: \N“‘I was shocked. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.95,0:05:40.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“‘[She should’ve been.] 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.89,0:05:45.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“‘This plea to Jehovah for Julie \Nhad come from my heart!’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.90,0:05:48.27,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Realizing how involved \Nshe had become, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.26,0:05:50.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“she stopped watching these programs. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.87,0:05:52.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“She wrote: ‘If all readers 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.87,0:05:56.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“‘will take your article \Non TV serials to heart, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.41,0:05:59.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“‘they will feel a real sense of freedom, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.38,0:06:03.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎since our own everyday problems \Nare enough to cope with.’” 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.48,0:06:07.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So, you see, our sister \Nhad the proper view of discipline, 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.18,0:06:11.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and she was able \Nto keep close to Jehovah. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.69,0:06:15.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, another one, \Nafter expressing appreciation, wrote: 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.36,0:06:18.96,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I realized that I was ‘addicted’ \Nto soap operas, 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.96,0:06:20.96,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and that I had to do something about it. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.96,0:06:25.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I wondered, too, if my relationship \Nwith Jehovah could be affected. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.37,0:06:28.24,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“How could I have ‘them’ as friends 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.24,0:06:30.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and also be a friend to Jehovah? 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.77,0:06:32.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I had to quit all at once
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.81,0:06:36.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—it was the only way, \Nand how hard it was!” she admits. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.88,0:06:39.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So, what did she \Nhave to do to break free? 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.12,0:06:41.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎She had to unplug her TV. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.12,0:06:45.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎She’d go outdoors \Nand work in the garden, call somebody
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.12,0:06:48.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—anything to stay busy \Nso that she wouldn’t go back 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.42,0:06:51.39,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to watching those soap operas. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.39,0:06:53.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎She took time for personal Bible study 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.73,0:06:55.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—that’ll keep you close to Jehovah—
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.73,0:06:59.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎preparing for her meetings, \Nand other spiritual things. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.30,0:07:03.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And then she confesses: \N“How much better I felt! 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.14,0:07:07.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“It has been over two years now \N[from this last writing] 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.01,0:07:10.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“since I have seen \Nthose so-called friends. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.05,0:07:12.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I must admit \Nthat at times I still wonder

Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.42,0:07:20.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Perhaps many others \Nwho have not yet broken free will now.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.86,0:07:25.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎She says: \N‘Thank you, Jehovah and you brothers, 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.19,0:07:28.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for exposing \Nthis “good-for-nothing thing.”’
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.80,0:07:31.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Then, finally, this third one says: 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.70,0:07:34.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I cried when I read the articles, 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.54,0:07:39.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“for I discovered that my heart \Nwas no longer complete toward Jehovah. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.18,0:07:40.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I promised my God

Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.91,0:07:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and asked him to help me \Nto get out of my home

Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.33,0:07:58.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I happily accepted. . . . 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.33,0:08:02.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“[and notice] I now feel \Ncloser to Jehovah, 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.20,0:08:05.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and my relationship with him \Nis more intimate. 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.37,0:08:09.47,Default,,0,0,0,,‎How good Jehovah is \Nto discipline us through his Word!” 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.47,0:08:13.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes, she had \Nthe proper view of discipline. 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.61,0:08:17.85,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, finally, \Nlet’s look in Hebrews chapter 12, 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.62,0:08:22.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and we appreciate \Nthese sincere comments 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.29,0:08:25.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and the counsel there certainly applies. 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.52,0:08:27.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Any kind of entertainment 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.52,0:08:30.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that has that corrupting influence 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.99,0:08:34.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎would be avoided by a true Christian. 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.06,0:08:37.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So here at Hebrews chapter 12, 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.10,0:08:39.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎notice verse 11:
