Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.25,0:14:19.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s find out what it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.25,0:14:22.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Turn with me, please, to Galatians chapter 6,

Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.64,0:15:52.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, one particular challenge\Nto gaining peace

Dialogue: 0,0:16:33.05,0:16:35.56,Default,,0,0,0,,We can prove this\Nby considering the Bible account

Dialogue: 0,0:16:39.02,0:16:41.31,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we’re familiar with the story.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:41.31,0:16:45.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Out of envy,\NJoseph’s brothers sold him into slavery.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:45.07,0:16:48.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And this was by no means a minor offense.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:48.28,0:16:50.95,Default,,0,0,0,,It began with Joseph being led to Egypt.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.95,0:16:54.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometime later, he was falsely accused\Nand thrown into prison.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:54.99,0:16:57.70,Default,,0,0,0,,So for 13 years,

Dialogue: 0,0:17:03.75,0:17:06.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, it could have been very easy\Nfor Joseph to feel

Dialogue: 0,0:17:09.34,0:17:11.59,Default,,0,0,0,,the best option for peace
Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.59,0:17:14.64,Default,,0,0,0,,would be not to have any dealings\Nwith them at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.85,0:17:18.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps we might feel the same way as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:19.52,0:17:21.90,Default,,0,0,0,,But Joseph didn’t do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:21.90,0:17:24.23,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, after some years passed,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:24.23,0:17:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,both Joseph and his brothers sowed peace.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.90,0:17:29.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, note how this was done.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:29.90,0:17:32.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Turn with me, please, to the 105th Psalm,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:35.49,0:17:40.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and note the 19th verse of Psalm 105.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:05.31,0:18:08.15,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, how interesting it is to note
Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.15,0:18:11.03,Default,,0,0,0,,that there is nothing\Nin the Scriptures to indicate
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.03,0:18:15.62,Default,,0,0,0,,that Joseph ever told anyone,\Nnot even Pharaoh,
