Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.93,0:02:29.57,Default,,0,0,0,,he was distracted \Nwith these mundane things. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.57,0:02:34.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And likely, he really didn’t hear\Nanything that Jesus had to say. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.24,0:02:36.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Not only was this man distracted\N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.85,0:02:43.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And no doubt those that were gathered\N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.48,0:02:53.49,Default,,0,0,0,,But did the distractions from this man\Nbecome Jesus’ distractions? \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.56,0:02:59.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Rather, Jesus refused to be\Ndrawn into this dispute\N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.83,0:03:35.27,Default,,0,0,0,,And it really wasn’t Jesus’ place\Nto get involved. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.27,0:03:40.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus did not allow this man\Nto break his focus—his spiritual focus—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.00,0:03:42.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and his real purpose \Nfor coming to the earth. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.54,0:03:44.37,Default,,0,0,0,,And what is that? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.37,0:03:46.98,Default,,0,0,0,,John 3:17 says:\N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.85,0:03:57.99,Default,,0,0,0,,So Jesus knew that it was\Nthe time and the place\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.99,0:03:59.99,Default,,0,0,0,,to give instructions to his followers, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.99,0:04:01.99,Default,,0,0,0,,prepare them for the future,\N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.73,0:04:09.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Knowing that we are imperfect\Nand easily distracted, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.93,0:04:13.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus reminds us in verse 15 \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.10,0:04:16.17,Default,,0,0,0,,of chapter 12 what is needed. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.17,0:04:19.94,Default,,0,0,0,,He said to them, not just to the man, \Nbut to all those gathered: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.06,0:04:37.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what was Jesus trying to get across? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.26,0:04:40.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, they had anxieties,\Nthey had distractions,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.76,0:04:43.10,Default,,0,0,0,,but they needed to keep focused. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.10,0:04:46.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Their eyes needed to be looking \Nat what lay ahead \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.17,0:04:48.74,Default,,0,0,0,,and how they could serve \NJehovah acceptably. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.74,0:04:51.47,Default,,0,0,0,,But he also warned against\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.47,0:04:55.18,Default,,0,0,0,,allowing anxieties\Nto turn into distractions. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.18,0:04:58.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Note verse 29 of chapter 12. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.68,0:05:02.09,Default,,0,0,0,,He said:\N“Stop seeking [or focusing on]\N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.76,0:05:11.26,Default,,0,0,0,,And verse 30 goes on to say \Nthat’s what happens in the world. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.26,0:05:13.20,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s what people are pursuing today. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.20,0:05:17.00,Default,,0,0,0,,But he said: “Stop. \NStop focusing; stop seeking.”\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.03,0:05:20.37,Default,,0,0,0,,And we think about the word “anxious.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.37,0:05:23.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus used this quite a bit\Nwithin this chapter \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.04,0:05:26.18,Default,,0,0,0,,and in other discussions\Nhe had with his listeners. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.18,0:05:29.31,Default,,0,0,0,,What does the word “anxious” mean? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.31,0:05:35.39,Default,,0,0,0,,The Greek verb rendered “to be anxious”\Nmeans “to have the mind distracted.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.39,0:05:38.25,Default,,0,0,0,,The word “distract,”\Nwhere does that come from? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.25,0:05:40.32,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s interesting to note that “distract”\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.32,0:05:42.99,Default,,0,0,0,,comes from the Latin word tractus\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.99,0:05:46.20,Default,,0,0,0,,meaning “to be pulled or dragged,” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.20,0:05:49.47,Default,,0,0,0,,and this gives us the root word “tract.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.47,0:05:54.27,Default,,0,0,0,,So to “attract” would be\Ndrawing toward something. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.27,0:05:59.21,Default,,0,0,0,,And to “distract” means to pull someone’s\Nattention away from something. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.21,0:06:02.41,Default,,0,0,0,,So this is what’s happening\Nevery day of our lives. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.41,0:06:07.28,Default,,0,0,0,,We could be attracted to something\Nor distracted from something.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.28,0:06:11.55,Default,,0,0,0,,And, really, distractions\Ncome in all shapes and sizes. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.55,0:06:14.99,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, my little illustration here\Nwill help us to appreciate\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.99,0:06:19.53,Default,,0,0,0,,that they come in various colors,\Nvarious shades, and sizes. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.53,0:06:21.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what happens with distractions? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.93,0:06:24.53,Default,,0,0,0,,We know that they\Ncome in from external means\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.53,0:06:26.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and sometimes from ourselves. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.60,0:06:30.14,Default,,0,0,0,,We cause some of our anxieties,\Nsome of our distractions. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.14,0:06:32.98,Default,,0,0,0,,But if we do not keep our focus, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.11,0:06:38.65,Default,,0,0,0,,They become our main focus. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.65,0:06:41.00,Default,,0,0,0,,We’re not able to see past them. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.79,0:06:46.26,Default,,0,0,0,,We need to continually keep\Nour eyes open \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.26,0:06:49.56,Default,,0,0,0,,so that we can continue\Nto serve Jehovah.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.56,0:06:54.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, distractions for all of us\Ncome in various shapes and sizes. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.56,0:06:57.97,Default,,0,0,0,,It could be\Nthe health concerns of our mate, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.50,0:07:04.67,Default,,0,0,0,,It could be the loss of a loved one\Nor how we can provide for our family. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.67,0:07:07.68,Default,,0,0,0,,It could be\Nthe responsibilities that we have\N
