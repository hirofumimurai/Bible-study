Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.19,0:00:08.29,Default,,0,0,0,,is indeed powerful encouragement.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.29,0:00:10.29,Default,,0,0,0,,By these reassuring words,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.29,0:00:13.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah reminds us of the potential we have.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.36,0:00:16.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Why can we say so?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.37,0:00:19.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Because Jehovah\Nwould never expect us to do something
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.14,0:00:21.61,Default,,0,0,0,,that is beyond our abilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.60,0:00:25.81,Default,,0,0,0,,And even if we ourselves\Nin certain situations might feel
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.81,0:00:29.35,Default,,0,0,0,,we do not have the strength anymore,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.35,0:00:33.02,Default,,0,0,0,,we know Jehovah will empower us.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.02,0:00:34.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Now,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.72,0:00:38.39,Default,,0,0,0,,when was the last time\Nthat you opposed the Devil?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.59,0:00:43.59,Default,,0,0,0,,We all understand\Nthe general concept of James 4:7,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.59,0:00:45.89,Default,,0,0,0,,and yet it might be a challenge
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.90,0:00:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,to get specific when it comes\Nto applying it on a personal level.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.57,0:00:53.67,Default,,0,0,0,,We are not having conversations\Ndirectly with the Devil
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.67,0:00:57.01,Default,,0,0,0,,as Jesus did \Nwhen he was tempted three times.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.01,0:00:59.91,Default,,0,0,0,,And we know that the Devil
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.91,0:01:03.05,Default,,0,0,0,,might not cause all of our problems,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.05,0:01:05.05,Default,,0,0,0,,but we also know
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.05,0:01:10.06,Default,,0,0,0,,that he is sure to use them for his purpose.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.59,0:01:13.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Therefore, let us try
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.89,0:01:17.03,Default,,0,0,0,,to analyze two examples, two areas,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.03,0:01:21.30,Default,,0,0,0,,where we oppose the Devil\Nand experience that he flees from us.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.30,0:01:25.20,Default,,0,0,0,,First of all, let’s talk about our health.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.20,0:01:27.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, health problems are something
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.60,0:01:31.00,Default,,0,0,0,,most of us\Nhave to deal with in one way or another.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.01,0:01:36.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Sadly, some of us even have to deal\Nwith serious issues or disabilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.01,0:01:40.01,Default,,0,0,0,,So, now, what does this\Nhave to do with opposing the Devil?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.22,0:01:43.69,Default,,0,0,0,,One of the subtle attacks of the Devil
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.69,0:01:47.29,Default,,0,0,0,,is that he tries to use\Nour proper concern for our health
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.29,0:01:51.90,Default,,0,0,0,,in order to shift\Nour focus away from spiritual things.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.90,0:01:56.60,Default,,0,0,0,,He wants to make use\Nof us being overly distracted.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.60,0:01:58.60,Default,,0,0,0,,He would like us
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.60,0:02:02.91,Default,,0,0,0,,to become consumed\Nwith matters of health to the extent
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.91,0:02:05.98,Default,,0,0,0,,that they take first place in our life,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.98,0:02:09.22,Default,,0,0,0,,or he would like us to go to extremes
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.21,0:02:13.01,Default,,0,0,0,,in striving to maintain our health.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.02,0:02:16.46,Default,,0,0,0,,But he has no success.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.45,0:02:20.66,Default,,0,0,0,,One of the reasons for this\Nwe find in Luke chapter 12.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.66,0:02:23.96,Default,,0,0,0,,I’d like to invite you to open\Nwith me to Luke chapter 12,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.96,0:02:27.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and we would like to read verse 25.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.46,0:02:30.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Here Jesus asked a good question.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.13,0:02:32.13,Default,,0,0,0,,He says:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.14,0:02:35.81,Default,,0,0,0,,“Who of you by being anxious
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.81,0:02:39.08,Default,,0,0,0,,can add a cubit to his life span?”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.38,0:02:44.38,Default,,0,0,0,,So while we take good care of our health
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.38,0:02:48.32,Default,,0,0,0,,in line with Jesus’ words found at Luke 5:31,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.32,0:02:51.59,Default,,0,0,0,,we are not becoming unduly anxious
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.59,0:02:53.76,Default,,0,0,0,,over things we cannot control.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.12,0:02:57.79,Default,,0,0,0,,At the convention,\NI talked to one of the attendants,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.79,0:02:59.79,Default,,0,0,0,,a brother in his 30’s.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.80,0:03:04.14,Default,,0,0,0,,At first, it was just normal small talk\Ntill later in the conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.13,0:03:08.40,Default,,0,0,0,,he revealed to me that he was actually\Nsupposed to be at the hospital.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.61,0:03:11.85,Default,,0,0,0,,The doctors had told him
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.84,0:03:15.31,Default,,0,0,0,,that he would not survive\Nthe next five months.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.88,0:03:20.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Would he now be fully absorbed\Nin finding some treatment
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.48,0:03:23.78,Default,,0,0,0,,and forgetting all of his spiritual routine?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.79,0:03:24.96,Default,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.95,0:03:27.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Our brother persisted\Nin getting some medicine
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.79,0:03:30.19,Default,,0,0,0,,to be able to attend the convention.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.19,0:03:32.79,Default,,0,0,0,,He wanted to serve as an attendant.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.80,0:03:35.17,Default,,0,0,0,,He wanted to care for others.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.16,0:03:37.60,Default,,0,0,0,,And so strengthened by the program,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.60,0:03:41.24,Default,,0,0,0,,he was ready to go back\Nto the hospital the next day.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.47,0:03:45.84,Default,,0,0,0,,We are not sacrificing our spirituality.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.84,0:03:48.34,Default,,0,0,0,,We maintain our spiritual balance,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.34,0:03:52.11,Default,,0,0,0,,and despite our challenges,\Nwe are caring for others.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.12,0:03:54.32,Default,,0,0,0,,In this way, we oppose the Devil
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.32,0:03:57.56,Default,,0,0,0,,—and some of us on a daily basis.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.86,0:04:01.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Now let’s look at this second example.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.22,0:04:06.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Another area where we successfully\Noppose the Devil is our attitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.06,0:04:10.90,Default,,0,0,0,,We all know that attitude\Nmakes a big difference in life.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.90,0:04:15.24,Default,,0,0,0,,For example,\Na positive or a negative attitude
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.24,0:04:18.68,Default,,0,0,0,,can influence\Nhow we deal with certain situations
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.68,0:04:21.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and how other people react to us.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.91,0:04:25.61,Default,,0,0,0,,The same is true with a complaining
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.62,0:04:28.46,Default,,0,0,0,,or a grateful attitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.45,0:04:32.35,Default,,0,0,0,,If we had a bad attitude,\Nnothing would seem right,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.36,0:04:35.96,Default,,0,0,0,,even when from an objective point of view,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.96,0:04:38.86,Default,,0,0,0,,life is just good.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.86,0:04:40.86,Default,,0,0,0,,It would be like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.86,0:04:45.87,Default,,0,0,0,,putting a dirty towel\Non a nice piece of decoration in our room.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.54,0:04:50.61,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what does this\Nhave to do with opposing the Devil?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.11,0:04:55.31,Default,,0,0,0,,A negative attitude can be used by Satan.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.31,0:04:57.38,Default,,0,0,0,,It can accumulate in our heart
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.38,0:05:01.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and overpower our ability to decide wisely.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.88,0:05:04.15,Default,,0,0,0,,We might lose our joy in Jehovah’s service.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.15,0:05:07.69,Default,,0,0,0,,It also can weaken\Nour resolve to resist wrongdoing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.69,0:05:10.16,Default,,0,0,0,,So do we see how the Devil
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.16,0:05:12.56,Default,,0,0,0,,would be able to benefit from it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.96,0:05:15.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, as Christ’s followers,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.97,0:05:18.81,Default,,0,0,0,,we avoid a negative\Nor a complaining attitude,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.80,0:05:21.77,Default,,0,0,0,,although this is not always easy.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.77,0:05:25.27,Default,,0,0,0,,And maybe we feel down
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.27,0:05:29.81,Default,,0,0,0,,because we are sometimes not content\Nwith what we’re able to accomplish.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.81,0:05:33.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Are we, for example, disappointed at times
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.02,0:05:36.82,Default,,0,0,0,,that we did not reach a goal\Nthat we set for ourselves?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.82,0:05:40.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe we were encouraged\Nto spend more time in the ministry,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.19,0:05:46.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and then things just did not turn out\Nthe way we planned them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.23,0:05:49.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And then we are sitting\Nin a congregation meeting,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.80,0:05:54.20,Default,,0,0,0,,and we are listening\Nto the nice experiences of others.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.20,0:05:56.20,Default,,0,0,0,,How do we feel?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.21,0:05:58.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Are we discouraged?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.21,0:06:00.21,Default,,0,0,0,,That can be dangerous.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.21,0:06:03.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s turn to Proverbs chapter 24 together.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.58,0:06:08.59,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s read together Proverbs 24:10
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.58,0:06:11.38,Default,,0,0,0,,because here this danger
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.39,0:06:16.00,Default,,0,0,0,,that can be utilized by Satan is identified.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.99,0:06:19.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Here we read at Proverbs 24:10:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.06,0:06:22.36,Default,,0,0,0,,“If you become discouraged\Nin the day of distress
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.37,0:06:24.37,Default,,0,0,0,,“[that’s what we’re talking about],
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.37,0:06:27.57,Default,,0,0,0,,your strength will be meager.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.51,0:06:34.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Prolonged negative feelings\Ncan rob us of our strength,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.08,0:06:37.08,Default,,0,0,0,,making us feel weak and vulnerable.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.08,0:06:39.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Satan knows this well.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.25,0:06:42.19,Default,,0,0,0,,It is difficult enough\Nif our heart is plagued
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.19,0:06:46.49,Default,,0,0,0,,with such feelings\Nof unworthiness or worthlessness.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.49,0:06:50.99,Default,,0,0,0,,However, when Satan\Nattempts to exploit such feelings,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.99,0:06:54.39,Default,,0,0,0,,it makes this situation\Neven more burdensome.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.93,0:07:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So as we maintain\Na balanced view of ourselves
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.00,0:07:05.01,Default,,0,0,0,,or, as the apostle Paul\Ncalls it at Romans 12:3,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.01,0:07:08.55,Default,,0,0,0,,as we maintain “a sound mind,”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.54,0:07:11.11,Default,,0,0,0,,we oppose the Devil.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.11,0:07:16.12,Default,,0,0,0,,As we remind ourselves\Nthat Jehovah just expects 100 percent

Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.24,0:07:39.41,Default,,0,0,0,,So when was the last time\Nthat you opposed the Devil?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.71,0:07:44.65,Default,,0,0,0,,We just discussed\Ntwo subtle forms of his attacks.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.65,0:07:49.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Probably we are all\Nopposing the Devil on a daily basis.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.39,0:07:55.36,Default,,0,0,0,,We do not allow ourselves\Nto be unduly anxious about health matters,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.60,0:08:01.60,Default,,0,0,0,,The fact
