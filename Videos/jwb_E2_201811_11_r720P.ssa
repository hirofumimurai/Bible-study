Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.28,0:00:02.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎You know, our text today
Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.79,0:00:04.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and the comments that we just heard
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.59,0:00:08.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎center our attention on our Christian hope.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.29,0:00:10.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Very soon, our loving Father, Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.79,0:00:15.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is going to eliminate pain, suffering, death,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.63,0:00:18.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and indeed, as has been commented on,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.23,0:00:22.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the happy memories \N‎will just push out all the bad memories.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.04,0:00:25.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“The former things \N‎[will indeed] have passed away.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.88,0:00:29.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, when I thought about Revelation 21:3, 4,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.68,0:00:34.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I thought to myself, \N‎‘I’ve heard those words hundreds of times,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.42,0:00:36.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘and I’ve probably shared those words
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.79,0:00:39.66,Default,,0,0,0,,‎hundreds of times in our ministry.’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.66,0:00:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And while most of us through repetition
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.19,0:00:46.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎have probably memorized \N‎those sacred thoughts,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.16,0:00:51.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎a good question I thought \N‎would be helpful to think about is,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.00,0:00:54.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Are these basic Scriptural truths
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.30,0:00:56.77,Default,,0,0,0,,‎still strengthening me now?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.77,0:00:59.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Are they, as Brother Cotton just mentioned,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.18,0:01:03.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎still serving “as an anchor for [my] soul?”
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.21,0:01:07.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎With that thought in mind, \N‎let’s consider three questions:
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.35,0:01:11.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎What is the hope \N‎as described in the Scriptures?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.55,0:01:14.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Second, why do we need hope?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.92,0:01:19.09,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And third, how can we strengthen our hope?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.10,0:01:23.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎First, how would you define hope?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.30,0:01:28.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Back in 1993, The Watchtower\N‎quoted a writer who said this:
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.57,0:01:31.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Most people seem to think that hope
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.21,0:01:35.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is just a dopy form of denying the truth.”
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.75,0:01:38.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Others today would equate hope
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.45,0:01:41.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎with optimism or wishful thinking.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.99,0:01:45.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And, of course, \N‎the Scriptures encourage positive thinking,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.32,0:01:49.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and there are benefits\N‎—emotionally and perhaps even physically.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.99,0:01:53.26,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But what do we call a desire or a wish
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.26,0:01:55.76,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that’s not based on truth?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.77,0:02:00.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎What is a desire or a wish \N‎that does not take Jehovah into account? 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.57,0:02:04.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, that’s a dream; that’s an unreality.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.57,0:02:07.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And, of course, none of us as true Christians
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.41,0:02:12.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎want to live in La-La land, \N‎or in a dreamworld, do we? 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.35,0:02:15.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Of course, the Bible \N‎does not use the word “optimism,”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.65,0:02:19.62,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but it does encourage us\N‎to strengthen our hope.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.16,0:02:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎What is hope according to the Scriptures? 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.99,0:02:29.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The original language words \N‎used in the Bible that are translated “hope”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.47,0:02:34.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎mean “to wait eagerly” and “to expect good.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.17,0:02:38.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In the Scriptures, hope involves \N‎not only the desire for something good
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.81,0:02:43.85,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but it includes the basis \N‎for believing that good will come. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.55,0:02:47.39,Default,,0,0,0,,‎That’s much more meaningful than optimism.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.38,0:02:51.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Hope, like our faith, is based on evidence
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.79,0:02:54.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—convincing facts.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.02,0:02:58.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And though hope involves \N‎our eager desire for something good,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.60,0:03:03.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎it does not start with our desires\N‎—what we want or what we wish for.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.60,0:03:07.44,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It’s first rooted in what God wants
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.44,0:03:12.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎with regard to his purpose\N‎and what God wants for us individually.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.44,0:03:14.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Romans 5:5 tells us
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.88,0:03:18.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that such “hope does not lead \N‎to disappointment.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.95,0:03:23.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So in a brief definition, \N‎we could say that Scriptural hope
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.69,0:03:28.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is eager expectation based on future realities,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.63,0:03:32.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎rooted in what Jehovah has taught us.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.16,0:03:34.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Our second question:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.23,0:03:38.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Why is hope essential for all Christians?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.33,0:03:43.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Please open your Bible \N‎with me to Hebrews 11:1,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.11,0:03:48.15,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and notice our well-known definition of faith,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.14,0:03:51.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but then notice how hope is associated.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.65,0:03:55.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Hebrews 11:1 says:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.32,0:03:58.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Faith is the assured expectation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.52,0:04:01.76,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“of what is hoped for,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.76,0:04:04.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“the evident demonstration
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.46,0:04:08.26,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of realities that are not seen.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.26,0:04:11.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So just as faith is a requirement
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.94,0:04:14.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for us to serve Jehovah acceptably
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.20,0:04:16.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and for our worship not to be in vain,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.31,0:04:19.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎hope, as an essential element of faith,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.74,0:04:23.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is also necessary for all Christians.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.68,0:04:27.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎To see the connection \N‎between faith and hope a little better,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.42,0:04:31.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎we might think about the example of Abraham.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.02,0:04:33.12,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, from a human standpoint,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.12,0:04:37.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Abraham and Sarah \N‎were way past childbearing age
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.59,0:04:40.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎when Jehovah promised them a son.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.20,0:04:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It’s interesting that in the Scriptures
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.20,0:04:46.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎both Abraham and Sarah \N‎laughed at the angelic announcement.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.17,0:04:49.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It was an amazing and tickling prospect to them
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.64,0:04:53.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to think that they \N‎would have a baby in their older years.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.58,0:04:58.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But how did Abraham respond to the promise?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.18,0:05:02.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Notice, please, in Romans 4:18
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.32,0:05:04.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎what the Bible says,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.72,0:05:09.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎linked to this discussion of the need for hope.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.43,0:05:12.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Romans 4:18 says:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.83,0:05:16.43,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Although beyond hope, yet based on hope,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.43,0:05:19.77,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“he had faith that he would become\N‎the father of many nations
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.77,0:05:21.77,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“according to what had been said:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.77,0:05:24.44,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘So your offspring will be.’”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.74,0:05:28.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Faith “based on hope”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.78,0:05:31.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—we see the connection better, don’t we?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.31,0:05:34.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎You see, Abraham’s God-given hope
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.02,0:05:36.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎gave his faith that he would have a son
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.79,0:05:38.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎a firm foundation.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.82,0:05:43.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎His faith, in turn, \N‎brightened and strengthened his hope.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.53,0:05:46.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So it was not only this conviction in his heart
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.73,0:05:49.77,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but it was the eager anticipation of seeing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.77,0:05:53.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎what Jehovah had promised come to fulfillment.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.47,0:05:58.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Another reason that we need hope
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.01,0:06:02.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎has to do with the storms \N‎that you and I are undoubtedly facing now
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.88,0:06:06.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or will face \N‎before the end of the system comes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.45,0:06:10.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In Paul’s letter to the Hebrews,\N‎he illustrated hope
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.45,0:06:14.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“as an anchor for the soul,\N‎both sure and firm.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.29,0:06:16.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So when confronting storms,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.29,0:06:21.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎what do sailors, \N‎both in ancient times and today, often do?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.10,0:06:23.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They lower the ship’s anchor.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.30,0:06:24.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.73,0:06:28.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, if the anchor \N‎takes hold of the firm seabed,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.34,0:06:31.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎it helps the ship ride out the storm.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.01,0:06:35.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It keeps that ship \N‎away from dangerous reefs or the shoreline.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.11,0:06:38.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Interestingly, \N‎when the apostle Paul was on that ship
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.48,0:06:41.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎en route to Rome in the year 58 C.E.,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.78,0:06:44.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the ship was in danger of running aground.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.42,0:06:49.43,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The Bible tells us \N‎that the sailors cast out four anchors
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.43,0:06:53.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—not just one, four—\N‎from the stern,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.30,0:06:56.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and as a result, \N‎the ship safely rode out the storm.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.90,0:06:58.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, it’s not hard to see the connection
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.90,0:07:02.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎with hope and our stormy times today, is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.07,0:07:04.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Our “sure and firm” hope,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.17,0:07:08.44,Default,,0,0,0,,‎our setting our mind with eager expectation\N‎of what Jehovah has promised,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.44,0:07:12.44,Default,,0,0,0,,‎keeps us emotionally, mentally,\N‎and spiritually balanced
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.45,0:07:16.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎no matter what \N‎is raging around us in our life
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.05,0:07:19.39,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—in full-time service, with our family,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.39,0:07:21.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎with our finances, with our health.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.92,0:07:24.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We can weather the storms
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.03,0:07:27.97,Default,,0,0,0,,‎because of our eager expectation\N‎of what Jehovah has promised. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.96,0:07:32.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Really, few things \N‎could be more stabilizing in our life
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.03,0:07:34.77,Default,,0,0,0,,‎than this eager expectation of what Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.77,0:07:38.84,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the God who does not lie, has promised to us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.84,0:07:41.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, that leads to a third question:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.01,0:07:44.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎How can we strengthen our hope?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.61,0:07:48.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, as has been commented on beautifully\N‎by our four commenters,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.75,0:07:51.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎we need to think specifically
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.75,0:07:56.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎about how Jehovah’s promises apply to us
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.03,0:07:59.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and what they will mean for us and our family
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.90,0:08:02.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎in the near future.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.13,0:08:04.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Though we serve Jehovah out of love
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.63,0:08:06.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—and that’s our principal motivation—
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.64,0:08:09.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Jehovah wants us to think about the rewards
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.37,0:08:11.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that he has outlined for us in the Scriptures.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.57,0:08:13.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He wants us to visualize
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.68,0:08:17.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and meditate on such blessings.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.41,0:08:20.28,Default,,0,0,0,,‎One sister, in referring to the beautiful artwork
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.28,0:08:22.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that’s in our magazines, said this:
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.92,0:08:25.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“When I see pictures \N‎of the coming Paradise . . . ,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.52,0:08:29.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I examine them closely, \N‎as one would a travel brochure.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.59,0:08:32.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“I endeavor to see myself there
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.06,0:08:35.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“because this is where I truly hope to be
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.36,0:08:37.56,Default,,0,0,0,,‎in God’s due time.”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.23,0:08:39.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Daydreaming?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.60,0:08:40.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎No.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.74,0:08:43.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Meditation on truths
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.31,0:08:47.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and on precious promises that will not lie?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.31,0:08:48.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.25,0:08:54.26,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Notice, please, \N‎with me at 2 Peter 3:11, 12
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.25,0:08:57.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎how the inspired counsel encourages us
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.05,0:09:01.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to strengthen and build up \N‎our hope in view of what’s coming.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.02,0:09:05.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Second Peter chapter 3, \N‎let’s read together verses 11 and 12:
