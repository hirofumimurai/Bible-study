Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.14,0:02:44.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, in the world,\Nflirting is viewed as a sport,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.65,0:02:48.49,Default,,0,0,0,,and it’s done\Nto increase one’s own self-esteem.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.48,0:02:51.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, that’s where ego comes into the picture.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.32,0:02:54.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Ego is “the sense of one’s own worth.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.92,0:02:57.69,Default,,0,0,0,,One source on the subject of flirting says

Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.17,0:03:06.77,Default,,0,0,0,,because the flirt is doing something\Nfor his or her own gratification,

Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.91,0:03:12.91,Default,,0,0,0,,But there’s something the apostle Paul wrote

Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.95,0:03:19.99,Default,,0,0,0,,that imperfect humans\Ntend to take to an extreme.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.98,0:03:24.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So let’s turn to Romans 12:3
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.52,0:03:27.06,Default,,0,0,0,,and see what Paul has to say,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.06,0:03:30.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Romans 12:3;
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.39,0:03:32.43,Default,,0,0,0,,he wrote:

Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.86,0:03:37.43,Default,,0,0,0,,“I tell everyone there among you not to think

Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.61,0:03:51.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, self-esteem is defined
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.05,0:03:54.65,Default,,0,0,0,,as “confidence and satisfaction in oneself,”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.65,0:03:58.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and it can range\Nfrom self-respect to self-conceit.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.15,0:04:02.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Some people have too little of it;\Nsome people have too much of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.03,0:04:06.17,Default,,0,0,0,,So Paul wrote:\N“I tell everyone there among you.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.16,0:04:09.70,Default,,0,0,0,,And what he tells us is how\Nto avoid either extreme
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.70,0:04:14.34,Default,,0,0,0,,of thinking too much or too little\Nof our worth in God’s eyes.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.34,0:04:17.71,Default,,0,0,0,,And Paul pinpointed exactly\Nwhere the problem lies
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.71,0:04:21.91,Default,,0,0,0,,because three times in the verse\Nhe used the phrase “to think.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.91,0:04:25.91,Default,,0,0,0,,He wrote that a person\Nis “not to think more of himself
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.92,0:04:30.93,Default,,0,0,0,,than it is necessary to think,\Nbut to think so as to have a sound mind.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.82,0:04:35.66,Default,,0,0,0,,So it matters how one thinks\Nabout himself or herself.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.66,0:04:39.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Consider the person\Nwho has too little self-esteem.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.43,0:04:44.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, Paul said it is necessary\Nto think something of ourselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.07,0:04:47.47,Default,,0,0,0,,It was never intended\Nthat modest, moral Christians
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.47,0:04:49.97,Default,,0,0,0,,had to develop an inferiority complex.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.97,0:04:53.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Our dedicated relationship with Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.68,0:04:56.98,Default,,0,0,0,,makes each of us\Nprecious and desirable to God,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.98,0:04:59.18,Default,,0,0,0,,and we should really believe that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.18,0:05:01.65,Default,,0,0,0,,So the one with low self-esteem
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.65,0:05:05.89,Default,,0,0,0,,is not thinking enough\Nof the right things about himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.89,0:05:09.39,Default,,0,0,0,,And what Paul wrote two verses earlier
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.39,0:05:12.46,Default,,0,0,0,,in Romans chapter 12 can help.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.46,0:05:16.03,Default,,0,0,0,,So let’s look at verse 1 of Romans 12:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.40,0:05:21.00,Default,,0,0,0,,“Therefore, I appeal to you\Nby the compassions of God, brothers,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.00,0:05:23.70,Default,,0,0,0,,“to present your bodies\Nas a living sacrifice,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.71,0:05:26.55,Default,,0,0,0,,“holy and acceptable to God,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.54,0:05:29.71,Default,,0,0,0,,a sacred service with your power of reason.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.81,0:05:34.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, doesn’t that describe\Nwhat we are endeavoring to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.88,0:05:37.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Haven’t we dedicated our lives to Jehovah?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.62,0:05:40.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Aren’t we striving to live holy lives?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.22,0:05:42.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Aren’t we performing sacred service
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.39,0:05:45.39,Default,,0,0,0,,and making sacrifices\Nfor the sake of the Kingdom?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.40,0:05:46.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Certainly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.83,0:05:49.50,Default,,0,0,0,,And all that is most acceptable to our God.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.50,0:05:53.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Our lives have real worth in Jehovah’s eyes,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.14,0:05:58.11,Default,,0,0,0,,so no one should have to resort\Nto frivolous flirting to boost their ego.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.11,0:06:02.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, consider the person\Nwho has too much self-esteem.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.21,0:06:06.15,Default,,0,0,0,,In his efforts to gain self-confidence,\Nhe has overshot the mark
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.15,0:06:08.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and has crossed the line
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.15,0:06:11.49,Default,,0,0,0,,between cultivating\Nself-respect and arrogance.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.49,0:06:15.29,Default,,0,0,0,,He’s overestimated his own worth\Nand thinks too highly of himself,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.29,0:06:18.93,Default,,0,0,0,,and he may behave\Nin an unpleasant way toward others,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.93,0:06:21.37,Default,,0,0,0,,as does the uncaring flirt.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.36,0:06:24.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Paul said something\Nthat applies here too
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.43,0:06:26.93,Default,,0,0,0,,at Romans 12:16,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.94,0:06:29.04,Default,,0,0,0,,verse 16:

Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.68,0:06:44.85,Default,,0,0,0,,So it’s important that we have a healthy,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.10,0:06:57.90,Default,,0,0,0,,because that governs\Nwhether our self-esteem is in balance or not.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.77,0:07:03.31,Default,,0,0,0,,No wonder that Paul said that we ought\N“to think so as to have a sound mind,”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.31,0:07:07.81,Default,,0,0,0,,that is, to have thoughts that are based\Non a true premise about ourselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.78,0:07:11.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Since it always helps\Nto look at the example of Jesus,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.45,0:07:16.46,Default,,0,0,0,,let’s do that, in this case,\Nby turning to Philippians chapter 2,
