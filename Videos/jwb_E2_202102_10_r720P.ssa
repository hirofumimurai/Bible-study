Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.74,0:00:25.74,Default,,0,0,0,,A lot of people still think like this,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.74,0:00:28.64,Default,,0,0,0,,as if God has a split personality.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.65,0:00:30.85,Default,,0,0,0,,They are uncomfortable\Nwhen they read in the Bible
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.85,0:00:33.49,Default,,0,0,0,,that God gets angry sometimes.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.48,0:00:35.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Why is that?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.49,0:00:38.59,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it may be for one of two reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.59,0:00:41.63,Default,,0,0,0,,First, there are outspoken critics\Nin this world
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.62,0:00:45.06,Default,,0,0,0,,who constantly try to discredit Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.06,0:00:49.20,Default,,0,0,0,,A prominent biologist, for example,\Nmade headlines a few years ago.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.91,0:00:59.88,Default,,0,0,0,,I stopped the quote there\Nbecause it gets much worse.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.88,0:01:03.55,Default,,0,0,0,,How blasphemous a viewpoint that is!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.65,0:01:07.42,Default,,0,0,0,,The more often people hear\Nstatements like this,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.42,0:01:10.79,Default,,0,0,0,,the more they tend to believe them.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.79,0:01:14.99,Default,,0,0,0,,There’s a second reason, though,\Nwhy some struggle with God’s anger.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.55,0:01:44.99,Default,,0,0,0,,So how can we help sincere persons
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.99,0:01:47.89,Default,,0,0,0,,get past their fears about God’s anger
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.89,0:01:50.06,Default,,0,0,0,,and draw closer to Jehovah?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.06,0:01:52.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s address the critics first
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.06,0:01:57.07,Default,,0,0,0,,and then see how we can reassure those\Nwho may be feeling insecure.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.07,0:02:00.11,Default,,0,0,0,,First, let’s make one thing clear:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.10,0:02:03.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah does not have multiple personalities.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.37,0:02:05.77,Default,,0,0,0,,When Jesus was on earth, he advocated
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.78,0:02:10.65,Default,,0,0,0,,the powerful truth that Jehovah is one.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.65,0:02:12.65,Default,,0,0,0,,When a Jewish scribe asked him

Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.82,0:02:19.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s read Mark 12:29, 30
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.72,0:02:24.73,Default,,0,0,0,,and see what his reply was in his own words.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.73,0:02:27.63,Default,,0,0,0,,He answered by quoting today’s text
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.63,0:02:31.30,Default,,0,0,0,,—Mark 12:29, 30.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.30,0:02:34.14,Default,,0,0,0,,“Jesus answered: ‘The first is,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.14,0:02:39.15,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘“Hear, O Israel, Jehovah our God\Nis one Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.14,0:02:41.38,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘“and you must love Jehovah your God

Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.38,0:02:51.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So for Jesus, loving Jehovah for who he is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.52,0:02:54.86,Default,,0,0,0,,(not for who we want him to be),
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.86,0:02:58.66,Default,,0,0,0,,is really the most important decision\Nany of us could make.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.73,0:03:04.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, the pagan nations had all sorts of gods\Nfor different purposes.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.73,0:03:07.70,Default,,0,0,0,,And they would worship different aspects
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.70,0:03:10.80,Default,,0,0,0,,of even the same God in different localities,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.81,0:03:14.31,Default,,0,0,0,,like the god Baal, for example.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.31,0:03:16.81,Default,,0,0,0,,And something similar happened\Nin other religions.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.81,0:03:18.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Say, for example, the Catholic Church
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.82,0:03:23.19,Default,,0,0,0,,with its different manifestations\Nof the worship of Mary.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.19,0:03:26.13,Default,,0,0,0,,But things were very different in Israel.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.12,0:03:29.99,Default,,0,0,0,,They learned that there was\Nonly one God, Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.99,0:03:32.79,Default,,0,0,0,,who was responsible for everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.80,0:03:36.91,Default,,0,0,0,,And each time they read Deuteronomy 6:4,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.90,0:03:41.84,Default,,0,0,0,,they were reminded\Nthat God had one personality.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.84,0:03:46.01,Default,,0,0,0,,So why does a God of love\Nget angry sometimes?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.01,0:03:49.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the answer is quite simple.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.11,0:03:52.15,Default,,0,0,0,,When rebels challenged Jehovah’s sovereignty,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.15,0:03:55.59,Default,,0,0,0,,he had to defend his name and standards.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.59,0:03:59.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Rebellion did make him angry and rightly so,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.96,0:04:03.36,Default,,0,0,0,,but Jehovah’s anger is always under control
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.36,0:04:06.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and guided by right principles.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.16,0:04:09.46,Default,,0,0,0,,As a Father, he had to protect his household.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.47,0:04:13.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Respect for his own name\Nand his love for his children
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.70,0:04:16.04,Default,,0,0,0,,compelled him to act.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.04,0:04:18.04,Default,,0,0,0,,At the same time,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.04,0:04:20.91,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah is “slow to anger
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.91,0:04:23.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and abundant in loving-kindness.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.81,0:04:28.35,Default,,0,0,0,,His fundamental mood is not anger, but joy.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.35,0:04:33.22,Default,,0,0,0,,And Jesus said that “God loved\Nthe world so much
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.22,0:04:35.66,Default,,0,0,0,,that he gave his only-begotten Son.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.66,0:04:39.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah has been, is, and always will be
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.23,0:04:43.13,Default,,0,0,0,,a God of unchangeable love.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.13,0:04:46.57,Default,,0,0,0,,First John 4:8 says: “God is love.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.57,0:04:49.77,Default,,0,0,0,,It identifies who he is.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.77,0:04:54.31,Default,,0,0,0,,But Jesus also said that God gave his Son
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.31,0:04:57.58,Default,,0,0,0,,in order that “everyone\Nexercising faith in him
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.58,0:05:00.02,Default,,0,0,0,,“might not be destroyed
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.02,0:05:02.62,Default,,0,0,0,,but have everlasting life.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.62,0:05:04.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Did you notice that Jesus said
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.62,0:05:08.59,Default,,0,0,0,,those not exercising faith will be destroyed?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.59,0:05:13.23,Default,,0,0,0,,So Jehovah’s personality didn’t mellow\Nover the years,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.23,0:05:15.23,Default,,0,0,0,,as if it needed mellowing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.23,0:05:19.80,Default,,0,0,0,,It didn’t transform\Nfrom one personality to another.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.80,0:05:24.71,Default,,0,0,0,,His severity today against the wicked\Nis no less
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.71,0:05:28.28,Default,,0,0,0,,nor his love any greater\Nthan it was in the past.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.28,0:05:31.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah does not change.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.15,0:05:34.99,Default,,0,0,0,,We can illustrate it like this, perhaps:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.12,0:05:39.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Criminals may know that a police officer
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.92,0:05:42.16,Default,,0,0,0,,is an arm of the law.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.16,0:05:44.60,Default,,0,0,0,,His children may see him

Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.67,0:05:54.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, the police officer,\Nthe father, and the friend
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.84,0:05:56.98,Default,,0,0,0,,are all the same person.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.97,0:06:01.98,Default,,0,0,0,,In each situation, a different aspect\Nof his personality stands out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.98,0:06:05.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And it’s the same with Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.31,0:06:07.91,Default,,0,0,0,,In harmony with his name,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.92,0:06:10.26,Default,,0,0,0,,“He Causes to Become”

Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.60,0:06:25.54,Default,,0,0,0,,So if we want to get closer to Jehovah,
