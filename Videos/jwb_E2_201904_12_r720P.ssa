Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.02,0:00:10.09,Default,,0,0,0,,designed to lure people away from Jehovah God.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.09,0:00:13.93,Default,,0,0,0,,And so we’re going to examine two approaches:

Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.11,0:00:24.11,Default,,0,0,0,,and the other he used
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.11,0:00:28.35,Default,,0,0,0,,on the oldest intelligent creature\Nin the universe.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.34,0:00:30.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s take the youngest first.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.08,0:00:32.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, that was Eve.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.08,0:00:35.82,Default,,0,0,0,,So taking advantage of her inexperience,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.82,0:00:38.86,Default,,0,0,0,,his purpose was to trick this woman
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.86,0:00:41.73,Default,,0,0,0,,and to seduce her.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.73,0:00:43.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, how would he do it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.29,0:00:45.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, as we know, he was behind a serpent.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.80,0:00:48.70,Default,,0,0,0,,He didn’t want to show her who he really was
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.70,0:00:51.44,Default,,0,0,0,,—what his aim really was.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.43,0:00:53.90,Default,,0,0,0,,His choice of words also reveal a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.90,0:00:57.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And our text is Genesis chapter 3.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.92,0:01:19.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what was his motive in asking this question?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.20,0:01:22.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, as was stated by one of the commenters,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.47,0:01:24.47,Default,,0,0,0,,what he was trying to do
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.47,0:01:28.41,Default,,0,0,0,,was to seed a doubt in her mind,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.40,0:01:32.51,Default,,0,0,0,,implying that Jehovah God\Nwas holding something back from her.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.51,0:01:35.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‘He was too restrictive on you.’
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.71,0:01:39.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it’s interesting concerning questions.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.07,0:02:02.27,Default,,0,0,0,,And in the case of Eve,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.51,0:02:14.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Her answer in verses 2 and 3 indicate this.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.52,0:02:18.32,Default,,0,0,0,,She said: “We may eat\Nof the fruit of the trees of the garden.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.17,0:02:38.68,Default,,0,0,0,,But Satan had her exactly where he wanted her.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.88,0:02:43.55,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, he was banking

Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.21,0:03:16.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Tragically, his gamble worked.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.56,0:03:35.80,Default,,0,0,0,,to this kind of reasoning\N—irrational reasoning, really—
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.80,0:03:37.80,Default,,0,0,0,,it can happen to any one of us.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.80,0:03:40.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah God created us as free moral agents.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.82,0:04:02.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what can we do\Nto counter that attack from Satan?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.36,0:04:07.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we have to know what is in our hearts.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.36,0:04:11.46,Default,,0,0,0,,If you go to Hebrews 12:15, 16,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.75,0:04:30.22,Default,,0,0,0,,He says: “Carefully watch that no one

Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.44,0:04:53.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So there is a need,\Nas he said here in verse 15,

Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.79,0:05:10.99,Default,,0,0,0,,maybe even find fault
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.99,0:05:15.76,Default,,0,0,0,,with the direction Jehovah has given on matters
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.77,0:05:20.41,Default,,0,0,0,,—maybe the sacredness of marriage\Nor the need for moral cleanness.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.40,0:05:24.54,Default,,0,0,0,,So we don’t want to be those kind of people\N—obviously.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.98,0:05:33.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, a seed has to be planted,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.05,0:05:36.35,Default,,0,0,0,,and then it germinates,\Nand then it grows into a root.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.35,0:05:39.35,Default,,0,0,0,,So it’s at the seed level
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.36,0:05:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,,that we have to give special attention.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.19,0:05:44.66,Default,,0,0,0,,We have to learn to identify

Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.00,0:05:51.40,Default,,0,0,0,,No one can do that for us\Nbecause they can’t read our heart.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.40,0:05:53.40,Default,,0,0,0,,The seed may even—
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.40,0:05:56.07,Default,,0,0,0,,We’ve never even voiced what the seed is,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.07,0:05:58.61,Default,,0,0,0,,but it could be\Nin our thinking and in our heart.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.61,0:06:03.35,Default,,0,0,0,,And these internal weaknesses\Nhave to be addressed
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.35,0:06:08.56,Default,,0,0,0,,for fear we find ourselves in a circumstance
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.55,0:06:11.42,Default,,0,0,0,,maneuvered by Satan
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.42,0:06:15.76,Default,,0,0,0,,to accentuate that particular weakness.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.79,0:06:21.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, James 1:14, 15\Nreally describes the process well.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.80,0:06:26.17,Default,,0,0,0,,James 1:14, 15, where he says:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.17,0:06:29.87,Default,,0,0,0,,“Each one is tried\Nby being drawn out and enticed
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.87,0:06:34.88,Default,,0,0,0,,“by his own desire [own desire].
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.85,0:06:39.95,Default,,0,0,0,,“Then the desire [the seed],

Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.89,0:06:52.39,Default,,0,0,0,,So, being “enticed by his own desire.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.40,0:06:53.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Does that sound familiar?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.73,0:06:55.73,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s a powerful force.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.73,0:06:59.27,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s one that happened to Eve,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.64,0:07:04.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what do we need to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.87,0:07:09.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, as we said earlier,\Nidentify the seed or seeds
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.48,0:07:11.48,Default,,0,0,0,,if that may be the case.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.55,0:07:19.95,Default,,0,0,0,,And if a “poisonous root”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.96,0:07:21.96,Default,,0,0,0,,may happen to be in us
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.96,0:07:24.73,Default,,0,0,0,,or starting to grow,\Nthen we need to rip it out.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.04,0:07:44.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, in this case, he didn’t try to hide himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.85,0:07:46.92,Default,,0,0,0,,He realized there was no need to do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.92,0:07:48.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus knew exactly who he was.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.95,0:07:51.59,Default,,0,0,0,,He understood the motive.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.59,0:07:55.93,Default,,0,0,0,,And so he just went overtly right to Jesus.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.93,0:07:58.77,Default,,0,0,0,,And as you know, in the account of Matthew 4,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.76,0:08:03.37,Default,,0,0,0,,he said, ‘Look, just fall down\Nand do an act of worship to me.’
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.90,0:08:08.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what does this tell us about Satan?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.54,0:08:12.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, he has long been driven by jealousy
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.61,0:08:15.85,Default,,0,0,0,,over the worship that goes to Jehovah God.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.85,0:08:19.39,Default,,0,0,0,,And he’s going to go to any length possible

Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.87,0:08:45.51,Default,,0,0,0,,And it makes no difference\Nhow spiritually strong we look on the outside;
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.51,0:08:47.98,Default,,0,0,0,,he will try to break our integrity.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.98,0:08:50.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Clearly, the Bible reveals that Satan
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.85,0:08:55.66,Default,,0,0,0,,is a deadly strategist in seeking his aims.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.65,0:08:57.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Happily, though, we don’t have to be like Eve,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.85,0:09:01.19,Default,,0,0,0,,because we know\Nthe designs of Satan the Devil.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.19,0:09:06.20,Default,,0,0,0,,May each of us cultivate\Nthe kind of love Jesus had for Jehovah God,
