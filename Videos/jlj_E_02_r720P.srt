<font face="Serif" size="18">I don’t see it. Are you sure?</font>

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,690
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, Father, we live on Mount Zion.</font>

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,620
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is where King David lived.</font>

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,290
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah said:</font>

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,710
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just like their father.</font>

28

<font face="Serif" size="18">Come on, children.</font>

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,930

00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,800
<font face="Serif" size="18">Everywhere I look, I see Baal images</font>

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">and smoke on the high places.</font>

36
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,990
<font face="Serif" size="18">The smell of their incense makes me sick!</font>

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,620
<font face="Serif" size="18">I’ve been king for 12 years now.</font>

38
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s time to act!</font>

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">I want to finish the cleansing work my grandfather started.</font>

40
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">You will need Jehovah’s help.</font>

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know.</font>

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,710
<font face="Serif" size="18">I’ve been praying about it day and night.</font>

43
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,710
<font face="Serif" size="18">Good.</font>

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">I will issue a proclamation:</font>

45
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,340
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let the word go forth that we will rid this land of idolatry!</font>

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,180
<font face="Serif" size="18">I’ve seen these cheaper.</font>

47
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,190
<font face="Serif" size="18">Take it or leave it.</font>

48
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,270
<font face="Serif" size="18">You keep raising your prices.</font>

49
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,660
<font face="Serif" size="18">We start here!</font>

50
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,370
<font face="Serif" size="18">No!</font>

51
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,340
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is what we will do to every false god in the land.</font>

52
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,990
<font face="Serif" size="18">Father—</font>

53
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,950
<font face="Serif" size="18">Father, wake up!</font>

54
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,160
<font face="Serif" size="18">Father, come on, this is no time to be sleeping.</font>

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">Josiah is on a campaign against all the other gods except Jehovah.</font>

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">What?</font>

57
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,590
<font face="Serif" size="18">Josiah is upending his own kingdom?</font>

58
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,340
<font face="Serif" size="18">This will not go down as easily as they think.</font>

59
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,760
<font face="Serif" size="18">Does he think people will give up their customs?</font>

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,100
<font face="Serif" size="18">their rituals? their whole way of life?</font>

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,030
<font face="Serif" size="18">He’s a fool.</font>

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal will rescue us.</font>

63
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,080
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal will rescue us?</font>

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">Father, look around!</font>

65
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,420
<font face="Serif" size="18">All over Judah and Jerusalem,</font>

66
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,660
<font face="Serif" size="18">Josiah is destroying Baal images.</font>

67
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,920
<font face="Serif" size="18">They can’t even rescue themselves!</font>

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,710
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the people—</font>

69
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,670
<font face="Serif" size="18">The people are supporting him!</font>

70
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,510
<font face="Serif" size="18">Go ahead and doubt, you disrespectful child.</font>

71
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,890
<font face="Serif" size="18">You have become disloyal to Baal and to me,</font>

72
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">your father, who gave you life.</font>

73
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,190
<font face="Serif" size="18">Never mind, I’ll come up with a plan.</font>

74
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,040
<font face="Serif" size="18">My lady Hamutal, a word with you, please.</font>

75
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,580
<font face="Serif" size="18">A word with you, please!</font>

76
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,040
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ben-Mattan!</font>

77
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,340
<font face="Serif" size="18">What do you want?</font>

78
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please, tell the king he must stop what he’s doing.</font>

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is madness.</font>

80
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,360
<font face="Serif" size="18">He’s endangering himself,</font>

81
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,230
<font face="Serif" size="18">his family, and our entire nation.</font>

82
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,530
<font face="Serif" size="18">Josiah’s campaign against Baal worshippers</font>

83
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,410
<font face="Serif" size="18">is a campaign against Baal himself.</font>

84
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,120
<font face="Serif" size="18">Oh, Ben-Mattan, you and your disgusting idols.</font>

85
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,290
<font face="Serif" size="18">Get away from me before I have the guards arrest you.</font>

86
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,630
<font face="Serif" size="18">Forgive me.</font>

87
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,620
<font face="Serif" size="18">I beg you, just another word, please.</font>

88
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,130
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hamutal, I’m only telling you this for your own safety.</font>

89
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,140
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’d be terrible if something were to happen to the king</font>

90
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,360
<font face="Serif" size="18">like what happened to his father.</font>

91
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,270
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hamutal,</font>

92
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,160
<font face="Serif" size="18">think of your children.</font>

93
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,830
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal worshippers are no match for Jehovah, Hamutal.</font>

94
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,510
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please don’t be fearful.</font>

95
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">But this campaign has gone on for a year.</font>

96
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">How long do we have to endure this?</font>

97
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,100
<font face="Serif" size="18">However long it takes.</font>

98
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,850
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes.</font>

99
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,520
<font face="Serif" size="18">My lord, Zephaniah the prophet has arrived.</font>

100
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,730
<font face="Serif" size="18">He brought someone with him.</font>

101
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,520
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you.</font>

102
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,490
<font face="Serif" size="18">I’ll see them in the throne room.</font>

103
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,920
<font face="Serif" size="18">Better check on the children.</font>

104
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please don’t show your concern in front of them.</font>

105
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,400
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah, have I gone too far?</font>

106
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,860
<font face="Serif" size="18">My own grandfather didn’t succeed</font>

107
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,870
<font face="Serif" size="18">in ridding the land of the high places.</font>

108
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,870
<font face="Serif" size="18">How can I do this?</font>

109
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,010
<font face="Serif" size="18">My lord, this is Jeremiah from Anathoth.</font>

110
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,010
<font face="Serif" size="18">The man whom Jehovah has called to be a prophet, welcome.</font>

111
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">King Josiah, all the faithful ones</font>

112
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,980
<font face="Serif" size="18">support your campaign against idolatry.</font>

113
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,190
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have done as you directed, my lord.</font>

114
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,940
<font face="Serif" size="18">And since you began this campaign 18 months ago,</font>

115
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,570
<font face="Serif" size="18">you have gained many supporters.</font>

116
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,410
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is true.</font>

117
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yet, many have continued worshipping Baal.</font>

118
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">Men like Ben-Mattan pose a great threat.</font>

119
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
<font face="Serif" size="18">The people may even resort to violence</font>

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,130
<font face="Serif" size="18">to oppose this great work.</font>

121
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,210
<font face="Serif" size="18">No doubt.</font>

122
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,590
<font face="Serif" size="18">My lord,</font>

123
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">do you feel that you may not have</font>

124
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">what it takes to complete such a task?</font>

125
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,070
<font face="Serif" size="18">Restoring pure worship will take much more effort,</font>

126
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,660
<font face="Serif" size="18">but it’s the right thing to do.</font>

127
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,990
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’re right, Josiah.</font>

128
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">But you’re not doing this in human strength;</font>

129
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,750
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah is on your side.</font>

130
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,840
<font face="Serif" size="18">He will give you the courage, wisdom,</font>

131
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">and strength to complete this work.</font>

132
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,340
<font face="Serif" size="18">When I expressed doubt in my own abilities,</font>

133
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah told me: “Do not say, ‘I am just a boy.’”</font>

134
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,720
<font face="Serif" size="18">But Jehovah spoke to you directly, Jeremiah.</font>

135
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,560
<font face="Serif" size="18">How can I be sure that he’ll back me up that way?</font>

136
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jeremiah just told me</font>

137
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">of a prophecy given hundreds of years ago,</font>

138
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">after King Jeroboam set up his own altar in the northern kingdom.</font>

139
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,030
<font face="Serif" size="18">“By the word of Jehovah,</font>

00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,030
<font face="Serif" size="18">“while Jeroboam was standing by the altar</font>

142
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,030
<font face="Serif" size="18">“to make sacrificial smoke.</font>

143
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,750
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Then he called out</font>

144
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">“against the altar by the word of Jehovah and said:</font>

163
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,600
<font face="Serif" size="18">Shaphan, the cleansing campaign has gone well,</font>

164
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,850

165
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,190
<font face="Serif" size="18">It has been neglected for decades.</font>

166
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">I heartily agree, my lord.</font>

167
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,850
<font face="Serif" size="18">Go up to Hilkiah, the high priest,</font>

168
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
<font face="Serif" size="18">let him collect all the silver</font>

169
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860

170
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,950
<font face="Serif" size="18">Give it to those appointed over the work</font>

172
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,290
<font face="Serif" size="18">Tell them to buy timbers and hewn stones.</font>

174
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">And who should keep account of the funds?</font>

176
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,380
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, Joah, no accounting should be required for the silver.</font>

177

178
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes, my lord, as you wish.</font>

179
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,060
<font face="Serif" size="18">The day my grandfather died,</font>

180
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,980

181
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,980
<font face="Serif" size="18">I kept this safe all these years,</font>

185
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,340
<font face="Serif" size="18">Shaphan, I found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah.</font>

186

189
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,070
<font face="Serif" size="18">Materials—as far as that goes,</font>

190
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,070

<font face="Serif" size="18">Shaphan!</font>

195
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">How is the renovation coming?</font>

196
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,700
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your servants are doing everything that was assigned to them.</font>

197
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,420
<font face="Serif" size="18">They have poured out the money</font>

198
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">that was found in the house of Jehovah,</font>

199
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,920
<font face="Serif" size="18">and they have handed it over</font>

200
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,090
<font face="Serif" size="18">to the appointed men and to those doing the work.</font>

201
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,420

202
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,010
<font face="Serif" size="18">Is there something else?</font>

203
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,470
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes, my lord.</font>

204
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,400
<font face="Serif" size="18">There is a book that Hilkiah the priest has given me.</font>

205
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
<font face="Serif" size="18">What book?</font>

206
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,160
<font face="Serif" size="18">They appear to be the words of Moses, my lord.</font>

207

<font face="Serif" size="18">“or feel compassion or protect him;</font>

277
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,950
<font face="Serif" size="18">“instead,</font>

278
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,960
<font face="Serif" size="18">you should kill him without fail.”</font>

279
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Observe the month of Abib,</font>

280
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,590
<font face="Serif" size="18">“and celebrate the Passover to Jehovah your God,</font>

281
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,050
<font face="Serif" size="18">“for in the month of Abib, Jehovah your God</font>

282
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">“brought you out of Egypt by night.</font>

283
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">“And you should sacrifice the Passover offering</font>

284
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,320
<font face="Serif" size="18">“to Jehovah your God . . . in the place that Jehovah chooses</font>

285
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">to have his name reside.”</font>

286
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,610
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please join me in making a covenant</font>

287
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">with the one true God, Jehovah,</font>

288
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,820
<font face="Serif" size="18">to carry out all the words of this book.</font>

289
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah, our God in the heavens . . .</font>

290
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,290
<font face="Serif" size="18">Amen!</font>

291
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,010
<font face="Serif" size="18">Amen!</font>

292
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,780
<font face="Serif" size="18">Bring them down to the Kidron Valley, and burn them there.</font>

293
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
<font face="Serif" size="18">And desecrate Topheth,</font>

294
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,610
<font face="Serif" size="18">so that no one can make their son</font>

295
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">or their daughter pass through the fire there.</font>

296
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is only the beginning.</font>

297
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,840
<font face="Serif" size="18">With Jehovah’s help, we will rid the entire land of high places,</font>

298
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,050
<font face="Serif" size="18">every vestige of false worship,</font>

299
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,840
<font face="Serif" size="18">and of everyone who promotes it.</font>

300
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,560
<font face="Serif" size="18">Once we cleanse the land of Judah, we’ll head north again</font>

301
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">to the cities of Samaria.</font>

302
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,780
<font face="Serif" size="18">Forward!</font>

303
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">To whom do these graves belong?</font>

304
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,220
<font face="Serif" size="18">They belong to the Baal prophets, my lord.</font>

305
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,550
<font face="Serif" size="18">Take their bones and burn them</font>

306
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">on the altar of King Jeroboam.</font>

307
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">Afterward, tear it down.</font>

308
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,290
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is the grave over there?</font>

309
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">It is the grave of the man of the true God</font>

310
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,420
<font face="Serif" size="18">who foretold these things</font>

311
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">that you have done against the altar of Bethel.</font>

312
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,060
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let him rest.</font>

313
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,060
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do not let anyone disturb his bones.</font>

314
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,280
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal, save us! Baal, save us!</font>

315
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,600
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal! Help us!</font>

316
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,860
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal! Baal! Hold it!</font>

317
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal! Baal! Hold it!</font>

318
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,450
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal! Help us!</font>

319
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,960
<font face="Serif" size="18">Father.</font>

320
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
<font face="Serif" size="18">My lord the king</font>

321
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,820
<font face="Serif" size="18">is a pale imitation of his grandfather.</font>

322
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">And now he’s turned my own son against me.</font>

323
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,940
<font face="Serif" size="18">That is not true.</font>

324
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,820
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is about standing up for what is right.</font>

325
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,410
<font face="Serif" size="18">Baal is powerless.</font>

326
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,950
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why can’t you see that?</font>

327
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,790
<font face="Serif" size="18">Powerless?</font>

328
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,380
<font face="Serif" size="18">I wish I had sacrificed you in Topheth!</font>

329
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,400
<font face="Serif" size="18">No one will ever be able to do that again.</font>

330
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,190
<font face="Serif" size="18">Josiah made sure of that.</font>

331
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,700
<font face="Serif" size="18">My lord,</font>

332
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,740
<font face="Serif" size="18">everything has finally been accomplished according to the Law.</font>

333
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,540
<font face="Serif" size="18">There is one thing left for us to make right.</font>

334
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,920
<font face="Serif" size="18">Command the people to hold a Passover to Jehovah</font>

335
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">as is written in the book of the covenant.</font>

336
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">What if the people can’t afford the Passover sacrifices?</font>

337
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,890
<font face="Serif" size="18">I will contribute cattle to the people, and my own flocks.</font>

338
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,440
<font face="Serif" size="18">With great pleasure.</font>

339
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,850
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Passover has not been held in grand style</font>

340
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,020
<font face="Serif" size="18">since the days of the Judges.</font>

341
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Be careful to obey all these words that I am commanding you,</font>

342
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,100
<font face="Serif" size="18">“so that it may always go well with you</font>

343
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,550
<font face="Serif" size="18">“and your sons after you,</font>

344
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,570
<font face="Serif" size="18">“because you are doing what is good and right</font>

345
00:30:40,570 --> 00:31:16,630
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the eyes of Jehovah your God.”</font>
