Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.09,0:00:06.09,Default,,0,0,0,,I was reminded of an experience \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.09,0:00:08.53,Default,,0,0,0,,I had many years ago as a missionary. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.36,0:00:11.63,Default,,0,0,0,,I was studying with a young man\N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.63,0:00:15.33,Default,,0,0,0,,in his church.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.33,0:00:20.00,Default,,0,0,0,,This man had got to the point\Nwhere he started to attend all our meetings\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.00,0:00:24.81,Default,,0,0,0,,while at the same time\Nstill attending his church gatherings. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.81,0:00:27.31,Default,,0,0,0,,The church, obviously,\Nwas very disturbed\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.31,0:00:30.58,Default,,0,0,0,,about the fact that he was coming\Nto the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.58,0:00:33.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and their headquarters\Nsent in a missionary from overseas \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.95,0:00:36.45,Default,,0,0,0,,to try and rectify the situation. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.45,0:00:38.72,Default,,0,0,0,,The young man told me what happened. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.72,0:00:40.72,Default,,0,0,0,,He said the missionary asked him, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.72,0:00:44.06,Default,,0,0,0,,“What is it that impresses you\Nabout Jehovah’s Witnesses?” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.06,0:00:48.60,Default,,0,0,0,,He said, “Well, one of the things is\Nthat they do the preaching work.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.60,0:00:53.20,Default,,0,0,0,,The missionary replied, \N“Well, our church can do that too.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.20,0:00:56.64,Default,,0,0,0,,So the next time they had a service, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.34,0:01:05.55,Default,,0,0,0,,demanded that everyone in the church\Ntake part in the preaching work. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.55,0:01:09.55,Default,,0,0,0,,He announced the time that they\Nwould have the group to go preaching. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.69,0:01:17.03,Default,,0,0,0,,But there was just one thing missing,\Nyou guessed it, the missionary. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.03,0:01:19.36,Default,,0,0,0,,He felt that it was enough\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.36,0:01:24.93,Default,,0,0,0,,just to encourage everybody else\Nto do it without engaging in it himself. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.93,0:01:29.94,Default,,0,0,0,,How different was the example\Nof Jesus and of our hard-working elders\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.94,0:01:33.58,Default,,0,0,0,,who do take the lead\Nwith regard to the preaching work.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.58,0:01:37.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Now let’s take our Bibles\Nand turn to a very interesting scripture\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.58,0:01:42.59,Default,,0,0,0,,in Hebrews 13:7, 17. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.59,0:01:46.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, I’d like to highlight the beauty\Nof the New World Translation \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.76,0:01:48.79,Default,,0,0,0,,in these two verses. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.79,0:01:51.13,Default,,0,0,0,,You see at the beginning of verse 7:\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.13,0:01:54.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“Remember those\Nwho are taking the lead among you.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.50,0:01:56.50,Default,,0,0,0,,And then verse 17:\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.50,0:02:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,“Be obedient to those\Nwho are taking the lead among you.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.20,0:02:04.71,Default,,0,0,0,,If you look at other Bibles,\Nwhether new or old,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.71,0:02:08.01,Default,,0,0,0,,most of them say “your leaders.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.01,0:02:11.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, obviously,\Nthe New World Translation Committee \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.82,0:02:14.75,Default,,0,0,0,,had in mind Jesus’ comments with regard\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.75,0:02:17.65,Default,,0,0,0,,to no one being a leader among us,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.65,0:02:20.79,Default,,0,0,0,,and although it’s a different\Nword in the Greek text, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.79,0:02:25.06,Default,,0,0,0,,still in English we can’t help\Nbut be sensitive to that matter. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.06,0:02:29.07,Default,,0,0,0,,And so this accurate translation\Nof saying “taking the lead”\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.07,0:02:33.67,Default,,0,0,0,,really summarizes, doesn’t it,\Nwhat the role is of an elder. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.67,0:02:37.57,Default,,0,0,0,,We’re not leaders, \Nbut we set the right example.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.57,0:02:42.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, this accurate translation\Nis also portrayed\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.21,0:02:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ \Nas recorded in Luke chapter 22, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.88,0:02:49.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and you’ll be interested to note\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.65,0:02:53.00,Default,,0,0,0,,that this is part of the revision\Nof the New World Translation text. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.06,0:02:59.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Luke 22:26, \Nit now portrays accurately\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.00,0:03:02.50,Default,,0,0,0,,the fact that both expressions in Hebrew \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.50,0:03:05.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and this one here are the same word. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.94,0:03:10.11,Default,,0,0,0,,So, Luke 22:26,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.11,0:03:13.84,Default,,0,0,0,,it says: \N“You, though, are not to be that way. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.84,0:03:18.28,Default,,0,0,0,,But let the one who is the greatest\Namong you become as the youngest.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.28,0:03:21.65,Default,,0,0,0,,And then notice: \N“and the one taking the lead,” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.65,0:03:24.55,Default,,0,0,0,,now this is the same expression\Nas in the Hebrews, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.55,0:03:27.59,Default,,0,0,0,,“as the one ministering.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.59,0:03:32.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So, obviously,\Nto take the lead means to do the work,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.60,0:03:36.53,Default,,0,0,0,,to be a minister,\Nto be a servant, to serve others.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.53,0:03:39.17,Default,,0,0,0,,This also reminds me, \Nmany years ago,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.17,0:03:44.17,Default,,0,0,0,,when I worked with the translation team\Nin the Pacific nation of Samoa. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.17,0:03:48.08,Default,,0,0,0,,At that point, we were trying to select\Nan accurate expression\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.08,0:03:51.28,Default,,0,0,0,, to convey this thought of “taking the lead.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.28,0:03:54.25,Default,,0,0,0,,And there were two words eventually\Nthat the brothers\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.25,0:03:57.15,Default,,0,0,0,,were trying to select between, \Nor choose between. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.15,0:04:00.26,Default,,0,0,0,,One was the word ta’ita’i\Nand the other ta’imua. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.26,0:04:02.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, you don’t have\Nto remember those words,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.73,0:04:06.60,Default,,0,0,0,,but as a foreigner,\NI didn’t really understand\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.60,0:04:09.50,Default,,0,0,0,,the subtleties between\Nthe difference of the two words. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.50,0:04:12.14,Default,,0,0,0,,So I asked the brothers, \N“How can you explain to me \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.14,0:04:14.30,Default,,0,0,0,,what these two words mean?” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.30,0:04:17.37,Default,,0,0,0,,So one of the brothers was very eloquent. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.37,0:04:21.41,Default,,0,0,0,,He said: “Well, just imagine\Na procession, a parade. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.41,0:04:24.85,Default,,0,0,0,,“So a ta’ita’i is the old man who sits\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.85,0:04:27.78,Default,,0,0,0,,“on the side of the road\Nbarking out the orders: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.78,0:04:30.42,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘You should do it this way;\Nyou should do it that way.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.42,0:04:35.29,Default,,0,0,0,,“The ta’imua, on the other hand, \Nis the one right in the front of the parade\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.29,0:04:38.33,Default,,0,0,0,,taking the lead\Nand everyone’s following him.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.33,0:04:41.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Which word do you think we selected?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.33,0:04:46.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Doesn’t that summarize nicely just exactly\Nwhat’s involved with being an elder? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.34,0:04:50.07,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s not a matter of sitting\Non the sidelines barking out orders\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.07,0:04:52.08,Default,,0,0,0,,but getting involved,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.08,0:04:55.21,Default,,0,0,0,,setting the right example,\Nand then others following. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.21,0:04:58.11,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is in harmony\Nwith one Greek lexicon\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.11,0:05:01.02,Default,,0,0,0,,that describes\Nthis expression this way, it says, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.02,0:05:03.99,Default,,0,0,0,,“The concept of leading can be expressed\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.99,0:05:06.79,Default,,0,0,0,,“by showing how to do something, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.79,0:05:09.19,Default,,0,0,0,,“demonstrating how we ought to do it, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.19,0:05:11.89,Default,,0,0,0,,and going ahead showing the way.”\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.89,0:05:15.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, on the other hand,\Nsome religions even view\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.70,0:05:18.70,Default,,0,0,0,,the expression “elder” as a title. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.70,0:05:21.70,Default,,0,0,0,,You’ve probably heard of them\Nintroducing themselves,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.70,0:05:24.61,Default,,0,0,0,,“Good morning, I’m Elder Jackson.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.61,0:05:27.31,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, of course,\Nnone of us would want to view\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.31,0:05:31.58,Default,,0,0,0,,being an elder as a title\Nin the sense of a position\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.58,0:05:33.68,Default,,0,0,0,,that lords it over others. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.68,0:05:37.39,Default,,0,0,0,,And with that in mind,\Nanother subtlety to the revision\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.39,0:05:40.22,Default,,0,0,0,,is seen in 1 Timothy chapter 3, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.22,0:05:43.06,Default,,0,0,0,,so please turn there with me, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.06,0:05:46.93,Default,,0,0,0,,1 Timothy 3:1. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.93,0:05:49.67,Default,,0,0,0,,These are well-known words\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.67,0:05:54.67,Default,,0,0,0,,—particularly when brothers are considering\Nthe qualifications for elders—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.67,0:05:57.61,Default,,0,0,0,,but you may or may not have seen\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.61,0:06:01.38,Default,,0,0,0,,the subtleties of the change\Nhere in this revision. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.38,0:06:05.95,Default,,0,0,0,,It says now:\N“This statement is trustworthy: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.95,0:06:09.49,Default,,0,0,0,,“If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.49,0:06:12.99,Default,,0,0,0,,he is desirous of a fine work.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.99,0:06:17.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you remember before \Nthe original New World Translation said:\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.99,0:06:22.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‘If someone is reaching out \Nfor the office of being an overseer?’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.87,0:06:26.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And that reflected\Nand no doubt was influenced\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.40,0:06:30.07,Default,,0,0,0,,by the King James \Nand many of the older translations\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.07,0:06:32.54,Default,,0,0,0,,that translated it that way. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.54,0:06:35.21,Default,,0,0,0,,But when we look at the rest of the verse, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.21,0:06:39.12,Default,,0,0,0,,we see that it’s not the office,\Nor the position, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.12,0:06:42.72,Default,,0,0,0,,of being an overseer\Nthat someone reaches out for;\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.72,0:06:44.79,Default,,0,0,0,,rather, it’s the work. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.79,0:06:49.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, the hard work that needs \Nto be done by an overseer. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.36,0:06:52.60,Default,,0,0,0,,An overseer recognizes\N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.68,0:07:11.48,Default,,0,0,0,,So with this in mind,\N
