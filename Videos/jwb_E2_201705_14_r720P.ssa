Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.03,0:00:13.63,Default,,0,0,0,,But then it adds: \N‘Better to be patient\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.63,0:00:16.30,Default,,0,0,0,,than to show a haughty spirit.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.30,0:00:18.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, if we’re patient, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.37,0:00:21.47,Default,,0,0,0,,sometimes a very grim-looking circumstance \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.47,0:00:23.74,Default,,0,0,0,,becomes much better in the end \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.74,0:00:26.68,Default,,0,0,0,,than we could have ever imagined \Nat the beginning. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.68,0:00:29.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, do we have a Bible example \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.38,0:00:32.12,Default,,0,0,0,,where this principle \Nactually plays out that way? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.12,0:00:35.42,Default,,0,0,0,,First Kings chapter 20, please\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.42,0:00:38.05,Default,,0,0,0,,—1 Kings 20. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.86,0:00:49.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So the beginning \Nis not looking very good for Israel. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.60,0:00:53.14,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, if you look at verse 7, \N1 Kings 20:7, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.14,0:00:56.84,Default,,0,0,0,,it says that “the king of Israel \Ncalled all the elders of the land and said: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.40,0:02:35.51,Default,,0,0,0,,So they caught up with Samson \N
