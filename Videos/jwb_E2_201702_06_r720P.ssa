Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.85,0:00:05.72,Default,,0,0,0,,When we look at this prophecy \Nin the book of Micah, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.72,0:00:09.19,Default,,0,0,0,,it’s very exciting \Nbecause it portrays to us \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.18,0:00:27.21,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’re involved with this. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.21,0:00:29.28,Default,,0,0,0,,We know that because \Nin verse 5 it says \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.28,0:00:32.38,Default,,0,0,0,,that at the same time \Nthat this unity would be evident: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.19,0:00:38.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that’s not talking \Nabout the new world, is it? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.86,0:00:42.06,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s talking about the time \Nwe are living in now. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.06,0:00:46.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, what is it that helps all \Nof Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.90,0:00:51.87,Default,,0,0,0,,to be so united and not to be involved \Nwith the wars of this world?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.87,0:00:56.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, one of the things that helps us \Nis our Christian neutrality. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.21,0:00:59.28,Default,,0,0,0,,What do we mean by neutrality? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.28,0:01:03.65,Default,,0,0,0,,We mean not taking sides \Nin political issues. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.65,0:01:06.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, we take sides \Nwith Jehovah and the Kingdom, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.75,0:01:11.62,Default,,0,0,0,,but with regard to worldly political debates \Nand issues that arise, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.46,0:01:16.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Why is this so important? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.69,0:01:21.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s turn our Bibles \Nto Revelation chapter 13. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.24,0:01:29.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and here it tells us: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.59,0:01:54.46,Default,,0,0,0,,What’s the point of this verse? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.46,0:01:57.27,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, of course, \Nwe will look forward to seeing \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.74,0:02:03.27,Default,,0,0,0,,and what pressure is put \Non God’s people at that time. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.27,0:02:05.34,Default,,0,0,0,,But even now, \Nwe see the principle here \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.34,0:02:10.25,Default,,0,0,0,,that the political system is wanting \Nto put its mark on us, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.25,0:02:13.42,Default,,0,0,0,,mentally as well as physically. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.42,0:02:17.39,Default,,0,0,0,,So we see the forehead \Nas well as the hand being involved. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.39,0:02:22.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So we need to be absolutely certain \Nthat we remain neutral \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.26,0:02:29.63,Default,,0,0,0,,not only by \Nnot being involved actively \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.63,0:02:35.87,Default,,0,0,0,,but also mentally not allowing \Nourselves to take sides.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.87,0:02:40.34,Default,,0,0,0,,What are some of the things \Nthat perhaps could erode our neutrality? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.34,0:02:44.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, maybe we could mention \Nthree things this morning. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.35,0:02:49.32,Default,,0,0,0,,One is the propaganda \Nthat the world puts forward. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.32,0:02:53.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we have seen what the media says \Nabout Jehovah’s Witnesses, haven’t we? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.39,0:02:56.89,Default,,0,0,0,,How distorted some of their reports are \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.89,0:03:00.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and how they can paint \Na negative picture with regard to us. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.76,0:03:03.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, should we expect \Nthat they are neutral\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.87,0:03:07.20,Default,,0,0,0,,with regard to other events \Nthat they report on, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.20,0:03:10.64,Default,,0,0,0,,particularly when there are conflicts \Nbetween two nations? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.64,0:03:14.44,Default,,0,0,0,,The media \Nin one particular nation may promote \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.44,0:03:17.11,Default,,0,0,0,,certain ideas about the other nation. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.11,0:03:19.22,Default,,0,0,0,,We may be affected by that. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.22,0:03:21.52,Default,,0,0,0,,We may be surprised perhaps \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.52,0:03:25.66,Default,,0,0,0,,to visit some other countries \Nthat have a different political ideology \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.66,0:03:29.33,Default,,0,0,0,,and be surprised to see \Nhow things perhaps are a little different \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.33,0:03:33.73,Default,,0,0,0,,in that country to how it’s portrayed \Nby the media in our country. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.73,0:03:36.20,Default,,0,0,0,,So we need to be careful \Nnot to be influenced \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.20,0:03:38.67,Default,,0,0,0,,by the propaganda of this world, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.67,0:03:42.31,Default,,0,0,0,,particularly media reports and so on.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.31,0:03:45.04,Default,,0,0,0,,What’s another thing perhaps \Nthat could cause us \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.04,0:03:47.31,Default,,0,0,0,,to lose a measure of neutrality? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.31,0:03:49.31,Default,,0,0,0,,Sporting events. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.31,0:03:53.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes sporting events \Nare able to achieve \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.08,0:03:55.72,Default,,0,0,0,,certain goals \Nwith regard to nationalism. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.72,0:03:59.62,Default,,0,0,0,,We see the national anthem \Nbeing played at many of these events. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.62,0:04:03.76,Default,,0,0,0,,It reminds me many years ago \Nwhen I was in a different country, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.76,0:04:07.66,Default,,0,0,0,,a friend of mine asked me \Nto record a certain sporting event. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.66,0:04:10.17,Default,,0,0,0,,I wasn’t particularly \Ninterested in the event, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.17,0:04:13.20,Default,,0,0,0,,but because he made this request, \NI recorded it. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.20,0:04:17.21,Default,,0,0,0,,And, of course, I wanted to make sure \Nthat I got the last ten minutes of it. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.21,0:04:19.28,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought our friendship \Nmay be strained \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.28,0:04:22.88,Default,,0,0,0,,if I didn’t get \Nthe actual last part of the game. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.88,0:04:26.85,Default,,0,0,0,,When I watched it, \Nit was absolutely exciting\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.85,0:04:28.85,Default,,0,0,0,,—nail-biting finish. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.85,0:04:32.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, after the brother \Ngave me back the videotape, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.36,0:04:35.02,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought maybe \Nsome of the other brothers \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.02,0:04:37.13,Default,,0,0,0,,who would be interested \Nin this sporting event \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.13,0:04:39.96,Default,,0,0,0,,may want to have it \Nrather than just wipe the tape. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.96,0:04:43.67,Default,,0,0,0,,So I offered it to several, \Nand each one of them said to me: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.67,0:04:45.54,Default,,0,0,0,,“No thanks. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.54,0:04:48.07,Default,,0,0,0,,If we had won, \Nperhaps it would be different.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.07,0:04:50.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what was the problem? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.21,0:04:51.37,Default,,0,0,0,,As I said to them, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.37,0:04:54.74,Default,,0,0,0,,“Were you watching the game \Nor were you taking sides?” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.74,0:04:56.75,Default,,0,0,0,,An interesting concept, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.75,0:04:59.78,Default,,0,0,0,,because here \Ntwo different nations were involved. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.78,0:05:03.59,Default,,0,0,0,,So we have to be careful \Nthat even sporting events \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.59,0:05:08.06,Default,,0,0,0,,don’t stir up within us \Ncertain nationalistic feelings, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.06,0:05:13.66,Default,,0,0,0,,and perhaps we could take sides \Nwith regard to certain events.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.66,0:05:18.37,Default,,0,0,0,,The third area that perhaps \Ncould erode our neutrality: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.37,0:05:23.27,Default,,0,0,0,,the political promises being made, \Nparticularly at election time. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.27,0:05:28.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps one of the candidates \Nis from our ethnic background \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.18,0:05:32.58,Default,,0,0,0,,or perhaps \Nis the same gender as we are. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.58,0:05:36.85,Default,,0,0,0,,When we look at the political situation \Nthese days with many elections, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.85,0:05:40.02,Default,,0,0,0,,it seems to be more in the form \Nof entertainment than anything else, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.02,0:05:44.26,Default,,0,0,0,,with music \Nand very colorful characters. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.26,0:05:47.53,Default,,0,0,0,,But if we were \Nto say in our heart, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.53,0:05:51.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‘I hope that idiot \Ndoesn’t get into power,’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.00,0:05:53.04,Default,,0,0,0,,are we neutral? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.04,0:05:55.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Or worse still, if we say, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.07,0:05:58.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‘I hope the other person \Ngets into power,’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.11,0:06:00.48,Default,,0,0,0,,well, we need \Nto be careful, don’t we? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.48,0:06:03.98,Default,,0,0,0,,I remember many years ago \Nas a young pioneer in Australia, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.98,0:06:07.28,Default,,0,0,0,,I was facing \Nthe conscription issue\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.28,0:06:09.79,Default,,0,0,0,,—the national call-up \Nfor the military. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.79,0:06:12.82,Default,,0,0,0,,At that time, \Nthe Vietnam War was being fought. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.82,0:06:15.59,Default,,0,0,0,,And then there was \Nan election in Australia. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.59,0:06:19.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And at that time, the party \Nthat was trying to get into power\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.40,0:06:23.73,Default,,0,0,0,,said that if they got into power, \Nthey would abolish conscription. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.73,0:06:26.17,Default,,0,0,0,,So now that affected me personally. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.17,0:06:30.77,Default,,0,0,0,,I remember how hard it was sitting there \Nwatching the election results, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.77,0:06:34.08,Default,,0,0,0,,not to say in my heart, \N‘I hope they get in.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.08,0:06:39.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And then, when they got in, \Nnot to say, ‘Yes!’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.72,0:06:44.05,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, if we personally are affected \Nby some of these political promises, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.05,0:06:47.42,Default,,0,0,0,,we may violate our neutrality. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.42,0:06:51.23,Default,,0,0,0,,So brothers and sisters, \Nlet’s work hard at remembering \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.23,0:06:53.23,Default,,0,0,0,,that we’re no part of this world. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.23,0:06:57.80,Default,,0,0,0,,We support the best government \Nthat could ever rule this earth. \N
