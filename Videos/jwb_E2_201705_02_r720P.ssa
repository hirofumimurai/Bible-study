Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.59,0:00:12.03,Default,,0,0,0,,And it’s based on Psalm 19:7, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.91,0:00:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,In the original language, \Nthe word here translated as “reminder” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.21,0:00:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,comes from a root word meaning \N“to go over again, to repeat.” \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.06,0:00:47.23,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, Jehovah tells us \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.33,0:00:55.74,Default,,0,0,0,,to repeatedly remind his people \Nof their responsibilities.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.74,0:00:58.74,Default,,0,0,0,,The apostle Peter \Nfelt the need to give reminders \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.15,0:02:13.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s consider three reasons. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.08,0:02:17.75,Default,,0,0,0,,First, let’s look at Psalm 103:2. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.75,0:02:19.75,Default,,0,0,0,,There it says: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.76,0:02:22.16,Default,,0,0,0,,“Let me praise Jehovah; \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.96,0:02:28.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Why, then, do we need reminders? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.26,0:02:31.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Simply put, because we forget. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.30,0:02:33.44,Default,,0,0,0,,If we had perfect memories, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.44,0:02:35.94,Default,,0,0,0,,we wouldn’t need so many reminders. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.94,0:02:39.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Even in everyday life, \Nmany of us use little notes\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.11,0:02:41.98,Default,,0,0,0,,to remind ourselves \Nof what we need to do. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.98,0:02:44.42,Default,,0,0,0,,And who of us \Nhasn’t seen the need \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.41,0:02:47.28,Default,,0,0,0,,for a list of reminders \Nwhen going shopping, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.28,0:02:50.15,Default,,0,0,0,,only to realize when we returned \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.15,0:02:52.95,Default,,0,0,0,,that we forgot to get one \Nof the important items \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.96,0:02:54.96,Default,,0,0,0,,we needed to purchase? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.96,0:02:58.00,Default,,0,0,0,,If reminders are important \Nin everyday life, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.99,0:02:59.99,Default,,0,0,0,,how much more so in matters \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.00,0:03:02.01,Default,,0,0,0,,that involve our relationship \Nwith Jehovah.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.63,0:03:08.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s read Luke 10:39, 40. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.01,0:03:11.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Speaking of Martha, we are told:\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.54,0:03:14.58,Default,,0,0,0,,“She also had a sister called Mary, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.58,0:03:16.95,Default,,0,0,0,,“who sat down at the feet of the Lord \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.95,0:03:19.65,Default,,0,0,0,,“and kept listening to what he was saying. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.65,0:03:21.65,Default,,0,0,0,,“Martha, on the other hand, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.65,0:03:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,was distracted\Nwith attending to many duties.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.46,0:03:28.36,Default,,0,0,0,,What was Martha’s problem? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.36,0:03:30.40,Default,,0,0,0,,She was distracted. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.39,0:03:33.53,Default,,0,0,0,,So the second reason \Nwhy we need reminders \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.53,0:03:38.14,Default,,0,0,0,,is that, like Martha, \Nat times we too become distracted. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.13,0:03:41.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Although we may already know \Na vital fact, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.07,0:03:44.04,Default,,0,0,0,,that fact might get put \Ninto the back of our mind, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.04,0:03:45.54,Default,,0,0,0,,figuratively speaking, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.54,0:03:48.00,Default,,0,0,0,,because other matters \Nare demanding our attention. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.85,0:03:52.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Satan is the great Distracter. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.78,0:03:57.29,Default,,0,0,0,,He tries to turn our attention away \Nfrom the true issues of our day. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.29,0:04:00.99,Default,,0,0,0,,People in general have become \Nmore and more distracted \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.99,0:04:05.03,Default,,0,0,0,,by entertainment \Nand other nonessential matters. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.03,0:04:09.50,Default,,0,0,0,,No wonder that Satan \Nhas succeeded in misleading so many. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.50,0:04:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,They don’t even realize \Nwhat has happened.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.34,0:04:16.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Reason number three \Nis alluded to \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.81,0:04:20.11,Default,,0,0,0,,at Matthew 24:45: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.11,0:04:23.65,Default,,0,0,0,,“Who really \Nis the faithful and discreet slave \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.65,0:04:26.42,Default,,0,0,0,,“whom his master appointed \Nover his domestics, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.42,0:04:30.59,Default,,0,0,0,,to give them their food \Nat the proper time?” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.59,0:04:35.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice that the spiritual food \Nis given to us “at the proper time.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.29,0:04:39.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Our circumstances in life \Nare continually changing. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.20,0:04:41.20,Default,,0,0,0,,How often do we hear, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.20,0:04:43.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“That was just what I needed?” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.50,0:04:46.87,Default,,0,0,0,,We’ve all experienced that, \Nhaven’t we?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.87,0:04:50.41,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what are three of the reasons \Nwhy we need reminders? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.41,0:04:53.98,Default,,0,0,0,,One, \Nbecause we tend to forget things. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.98,0:04:57.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Two, \Nwe often become distracted. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.55,0:05:00.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Three, \Nour changed circumstances \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.78,0:05:04.28,Default,,0,0,0,,may require a reminder \Nof something we already knew \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.29,0:05:07.86,Default,,0,0,0,,but didn’t fully need at that time.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.86,0:05:10.76,Default,,0,0,0,,So that brings us to the next question: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.76,0:05:13.26,Default,,0,0,0,,What will help us to remember? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.26,0:05:17.80,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s interesting to note \Nthat Jehovah has used many ways \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.80,0:05:20.74,Default,,0,0,0,,to remind his people \Nof what they should do. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.74,0:05:24.38,Default,,0,0,0,,At Numbers 10:10, we’re told\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.37,0:05:27.74,Default,,0,0,0,, that the various festivals \Nwere given as reminders, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.74,0:05:30.00,Default,,0,0,0,,especially the celebration \Nof the Passover. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.68,0:05:34.08,Default,,0,0,0,,That means \Nthat every time the Israelites \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.08,0:05:37.08,Default,,0,0,0,,prepared and celebrated \None of these festivals, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.09,0:05:39.93,Default,,0,0,0,,they were reminded \Nof important matters, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.92,0:05:43.22,Default,,0,0,0,,such as how Jehovah \Nprovides for his people \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.23,0:05:46.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and how he has saved them \Nin the past. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.60,0:05:48.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Something similar happens today \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.77,0:05:51.64,Default,,0,0,0,,at the commemoration \Nof the Lord’s Evening Meal. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.63,0:05:55.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Not only do we hear \Nthe reminders from God’s Word \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.47,0:05:58.67,Default,,0,0,0,,but the act of passing \Nthe bread and wine \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.67,0:06:01.67,Default,,0,0,0,,also serves as an action\Nthat reminds us \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.68,0:06:04.00,Default,,0,0,0,,of what Jesus did in our behalf.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.15,0:06:08.55,Default,,0,0,0,,But what do we need to do\Nin order for those reminders\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.55,0:06:11.00,Default,,0,0,0,,to have a beneficial impact \Non our lives? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.09,0:06:17.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice what Psalm 119:99 says. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.59,0:06:18.73,Default,,0,0,0,,It tells us: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.73,0:06:22.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“I have more insight than all my teachers, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.50,0:06:26.50,Default,,0,0,0,,because I ponder over your reminders.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.50,0:06:29.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, we need to ponder \Nover these reminders. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.51,0:06:33.28,Default,,0,0,0,,That means not just \Nlistening to or reading them, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.28,0:06:36.45,Default,,0,0,0,,but it involves thinking deeply \Nabout them— \N

Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.65,0:06:42.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Just to listen or read  without meditating \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.02,0:06:45.02,Default,,0,0,0,,is like looking through the lens \Nof a movie camera \N

Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.82,0:06:50.46,Default,,0,0,0,,We see things and hear things, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.50,0:06:56.77,Default,,0,0,0,,So we need \Nto meditate, visualize, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.14,0:07:02.48,Default,,0,0,0,,This will help us \Nto remember what we learn.\N
