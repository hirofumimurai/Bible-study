Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.32,0:01:47.22,Default,,0,0,0,,But as you dear students realize,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.22,0:01:50.56,Default,,0,0,0,,the Gilead program\Nand the training that you’ve received
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.56,0:01:53.43,Default,,0,0,0,,is all about glorifying Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.43,0:01:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and that’s why the theme\Nof our introductory comments are
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.00,0:02:02.01,Default,,0,0,0,,“Always Seek Jehovah’s Glory\Nand Not Your Own Glory.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.01,0:02:05.05,Default,,0,0,0,,And that’s in harmony\Nwith what the Scriptures tell us.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.04,0:02:09.14,Default,,0,0,0,,If you’d like to turn with me, please,\Nto the book of Romans
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.15,0:02:11.72,Default,,0,0,0,,—Romans chapter 12
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.71,0:02:16.48,Default,,0,0,0,,and notice what verses 3 and 16 remind us.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.49,0:02:19.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Romans 12:3:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.86,0:02:22.96,Default,,0,0,0,,“For through the undeserved kindness\Ngiven to me,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.77,0:02:35.64,Default,,0,0,0,,each one as God\Nhas given to him a measure of faith.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.64,0:02:37.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice the point there:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.64,0:02:41.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Whatever we have\Nhas been given to us by Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.28,0:02:44.58,Default,,0,0,0,,So we shouldn’t think\Nmore of ourselves than is necessary.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.58,0:02:47.62,Default,,0,0,0,,And then verse 16 reminds us:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.62,0:02:51.39,Default,,0,0,0,,“Have the same attitude\Ntoward others as toward yourselves;
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.39,0:02:54.69,Default,,0,0,0,,“do not set your mind on lofty things,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.33,0:03:01.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Do not become wise in your own eyes.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.40,0:03:05.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we trust that you \Nfully understand that admonition
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.87,0:03:08.91,Default,,0,0,0,,because your Gilead training\Nhas been helping you
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.91,0:03:11.48,Default,,0,0,0,,to strengthen\Nyour relationship with Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.47,0:03:14.51,Default,,0,0,0,,and when we know Jehovah,\Nwe can’t help but glorify him
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.51,0:03:18.82,Default,,0,0,0,,because we know\Nthat any good things we have come from him.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.82,0:03:21.52,Default,,0,0,0,,But now, as you graduate
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.52,0:03:25.12,Default,,0,0,0,,and you go either back\Nto your former assignments
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.12,0:03:27.12,Default,,0,0,0,,or to new assignments,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.12,0:03:30.62,Default,,0,0,0,,you may find various tests to this resolve
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.63,0:03:35.10,Default,,0,0,0,,—that you have to always glorify\NJehovah and not yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.10,0:03:37.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what might be some of those tests?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.63,0:03:40.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, one is perhaps an obvious test.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.34,0:03:43.58,Default,,0,0,0,,You go back maybe to your former assignment,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.57,0:03:46.71,Default,,0,0,0,,and the brothers say,\N“Oh, you’ve changed;
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.71,0:03:49.85,Default,,0,0,0,,you’re so much better.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.85,0:03:52.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that’s humbling in itself, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.12,0:03:55.12,Default,,0,0,0,,You didn’t realize\Nhow bad you were before you left.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.85,0:04:00.22,Default,,0,0,0,,“And your knowledge, the illustrations,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.22,0:04:02.72,Default,,0,0,0,,the way you’re teaching seems so much better”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.73,0:04:04.30,Default,,0,0,0,,—so now what’s your reaction?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.29,0:04:07.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I’m sure you’re not going to say:\N“You’re welcome.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.83,0:04:11.23,Default,,0,0,0,,I noticed that too.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.23,0:04:13.87,Default,,0,0,0,,I know (and I’m sure all of us know)
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.87,0:04:17.57,Default,,0,0,0,,that you’ll be determined\Nin a situation like that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.57,0:04:20.91,Default,,0,0,0,,to bring glory to Jehovah\Nand not to yourselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.91,0:04:23.58,Default,,0,0,0,,So perhaps that’s the easy time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.58,0:04:27.08,Default,,0,0,0,,because that’s obvious we have to be careful.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.08,0:04:30.62,Default,,0,0,0,,But when is the other occasion, or situation,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.62,0:04:32.92,Default,,0,0,0,,where we may be tempted
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.92,0:04:36.76,Default,,0,0,0,,to show a measure\Nof pride and glorify ourselves?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.76,0:04:40.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it could be if people criticize us
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.90,0:04:45.07,Default,,0,0,0,,or perhaps don’t show us the respect\Nthat we feel that we deserve.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.07,0:04:49.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Or maybe we don’t get the privileges\Nthat we hope to receive.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.34,0:04:52.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, that could be a temptation for us
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.51,0:04:57.25,Default,,0,0,0,,—to remind everyone of the special training
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.25,0:05:01.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and the fact\Nthat we graduated from that training.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.02,0:05:04.66,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, this is similar
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.65,0:05:07.82,Default,,0,0,0,,to the trap that Job fell into.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.82,0:05:10.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, when we think of Job,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.49,0:05:14.36,Default,,0,0,0,,we think of a very faithful man\N—a man of integrity.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.36,0:05:17.86,Default,,0,0,0,,The two words go together:\NJob and integrity.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.87,0:05:22.88,Default,,0,0,0,,But we also realize that Job\Nneeded to have very strong counsel.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.87,0:05:26.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, at what point in his life
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.04,0:05:30.41,Default,,0,0,0,,did he do something\Nthat warranted him getting counsel?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.41,0:05:32.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s think about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.12,0:05:34.89,Default,,0,0,0,,We won’t read the verses\Nbecause you know them well,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.88,0:05:39.02,Default,,0,0,0,,but in chapter 1,\Nremember that Job lost everything
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.02,0:05:43.46,Default,,0,0,0,,—his children and his possessions\None after the other.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.46,0:05:47.10,Default,,0,0,0,,But when we look at Job 1:22,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.10,0:05:51.07,Default,,0,0,0,,it tells us there that “Job did not sin.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.07,0:05:54.11,Default,,0,0,0,,He didn’t “accuse God\Nof doing anything wrong.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.10,0:05:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So all these horrific things happened to him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.01,0:06:01.65,Default,,0,0,0,,He had these huge tests,\Nand he came out looking pretty good.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.64,0:06:04.34,Default,,0,0,0,,He hadn’t sinned at that point.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.35,0:06:06.99,Default,,0,0,0,,So then what happened in the second round?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.98,0:06:10.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, you remember\Nthat he had this loathsome disease,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.89,0:06:14.43,Default,,0,0,0,,and then his wife said to him,\N“Curse God and die!”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.42,0:06:17.56,Default,,0,0,0,,So now, is that when he deserved some counsel?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.56,0:06:18.36,Default,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.36,0:06:20.43,Default,,0,0,0,,In chapter 2 of Job and verse 10,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.43,0:06:24.53,Default,,0,0,0,,it tells us\Nthat he “did not sin with his lips.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.53,0:06:28.33,Default,,0,0,0,,So at that point,\Nhe was winning we might say.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.34,0:06:31.58,Default,,0,0,0,,He proved himself an integrity keeper.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.57,0:06:36.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So when was it\Nthat he started to make a few mistakes
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.31,0:06:39.21,Default,,0,0,0,,that resulted in getting that strong counsel?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.22,0:06:43.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, The Watchtower, back in 1980, tells us.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.05,0:06:46.55,Default,,0,0,0,,It said that it was\Nwhen these three so-called friends
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.56,0:06:48.56,Default,,0,0,0,,started to criticize him and said:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.56,0:06:50.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‘Maybe you did this.\NMaybe you did that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.59,0:06:53.06,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s the—\NThere’s a reason.’
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.06,0:06:55.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Then The Watchtower said
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.30,0:06:58.70,Default,,0,0,0,,that because of these false accusations,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.70,0:07:01.60,Default,,0,0,0,,it’s as if it pushed Job over the edge
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.60,0:07:06.47,Default,,0,0,0,,and he vigorously determined to justify himself
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.48,0:07:09.15,Default,,0,0,0,,even though that inferred \Nthat maybe Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.15,0:07:11.42,Default,,0,0,0,,wasn’t treating him correctly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.41,0:07:13.98,Default,,0,0,0,,So do we see that this is a situation
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.98,0:07:18.89,Default,,0,0,0,,where if we are criticized\Nor some false accusations are made about us,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.89,0:07:22.29,Default,,0,0,0,,then all of a sudden,\Nthe self-justification can come in?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.29,0:07:25.33,Default,,0,0,0,,And what is self-justification?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.33,0:07:30.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Glorifying ourselves\Nrather than glorifying Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.33,0:07:34.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, our Lord Jesus Christ\Nis an excellent example in that regard.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.97,0:07:37.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s have a look at the record
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.71,0:07:40.98,Default,,0,0,0,,recorded in John chapter 8
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.98,0:07:45.22,Default,,0,0,0,,—John 8:48-50.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.21,0:07:48.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Now here,\Nwe have a group of Jewish persons
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.75,0:07:52.29,Default,,0,0,0,,criticizing Jesus,\Nfalsely accusing him of something.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.29,0:07:54.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice there in verse 48:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.29,0:07:57.93,Default,,0,0,0,,“In answer the Jews said to him\N[that is, to Jesus]:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.93,0:08:02.03,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Are we not right in saying,\N“You are a Samaritan

Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.90,0:08:08.90,Default,,0,0,0,,On another occasion,\Nthey said, ‘You’re out of your mind.’
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.91,0:08:11.61,Default,,0,0,0,,But now, what did Jesus do?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.61,0:08:16.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Did he fall into the trap\Nthat Job fell into and try to justify himself?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.51,0:08:20.08,Default,,0,0,0,,No.\NHe just made a simple comment in verse 49:
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.08,0:08:25.09,Default,,0,0,0,,“I do not have a demon,\Nbut I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.09,0:08:30.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Then he says:\N“But I am not seeking glory for myself;
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.09,0:08:33.89,Default,,0,0,0,,there is One who is seeking and judging.”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.90,0:08:37.07,Default,,0,0,0,,We see the excellent example\Nof our Lord Jesus
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.07,0:08:40.81,Default,,0,0,0,,in that difficult situation,\Nwhere he was falsely accused
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.80,0:08:44.84,Default,,0,0,0,,yet still focused on glorifying Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.84,0:08:48.11,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what’s the lesson there for each one of us
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.11,0:08:50.75,Default,,0,0,0,,—not only yourselves but all of us?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.75,0:08:54.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, you don’t need to remind other people
