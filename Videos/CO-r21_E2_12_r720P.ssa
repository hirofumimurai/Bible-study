Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.28,0:05:44.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, these were the humble words\Nof Jesus’ apostles

Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.16,0:05:51.29,Default,,0,0,0,,and they were humbly pleading for such.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.29,0:05:53.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we feel the same way, don’t we?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.37,0:05:55.83,Default,,0,0,0,,We know we need more faith,

Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.92,0:06:00.92,Default,,0,0,0,,But now the question is,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.99,0:06:32.00,Default,,0,0,0,,The first symposium showed\Nhow the Bible builds faith

Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.46,0:06:37.84,Default,,0,0,0,,it builds faith in itself,\Nthat it’s the Word of God;
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.83,0:06:40.92,Default,,0,0,0,,it builds faith in God’s moral standards;
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.92,0:06:45.05,Default,,0,0,0,,and it builds faith in God’s love for us.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.05,0:06:47.05,Default,,0,0,0,,But now we ask that first part,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.05,0:06:50.55,Default,,0,0,0,,How does the Bible build faith\Nin God’s existence?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.56,0:06:54.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, for one thing, within its pages,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.06,0:06:57.65,Default,,0,0,0,,it gives us common sense,\Nreasoning from scriptures

Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.58,0:07:15.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, you could never convince\Nany sane person
