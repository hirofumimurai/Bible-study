Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.23,0:00:13.80,Default,,0,0,0,,But the question is,

Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.79,0:00:41.86,Default,,0,0,0,,It says:\N“The conclusion of the matter,

Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.77,0:00:57.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So the obligation begins\Nwith fearing the true God
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.77,0:00:59.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and then keeping\Nhis commandments.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.94,0:01:01.61,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what does it mean to fear?

Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.26,0:02:32.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, of course, the stories\Nof the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.47,0:02:34.47,Default,,0,0,0,,was one thing they heard
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.47,0:02:38.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and also the mighty acts of Jehovah God\Nin connection with his people.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.54,0:02:42.34,Default,,0,0,0,,And then when Israel\Nfirst penetrated Canaan

Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.04,0:03:11.08,Default,,0,0,0,,it moved her to put faith in him.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.07,0:03:14.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, if you just glance\Nthrough Joshua chapter 8,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.58,0:03:19.25,Default,,0,0,0,,we find that following\Nthat great destruction,

Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.05,0:03:57.66,Default,,0,0,0,,But now, notice the different reaction\Nit had upon the Gibeonites.
