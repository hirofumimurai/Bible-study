Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.44,0:02:35.71,Default,,0,0,0,,And that was simply\Nbecause perhaps in this branch territory,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.94,0:02:41.11,Default,,0,0,0,,or they didn’t have enough congregations

Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.18,0:02:49.59,Default,,0,0,0,,And that, of course, poses a challenge\Nif the CO doesn’t speak that language

Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.06,0:03:02.56,Default,,0,0,0,,And some publishers\Nin these groups perhaps felt isolated.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.57,0:03:06.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Besides,\Nthey didn’t necessarily have circuit assemblies

Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.94,0:03:12.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Right. But I know the Governing Body\Nmade a change about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.74,0:03:14.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, and that was excellent.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.78,0:03:16.18,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, it’s a beautiful project.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.60,0:03:39.30,Default,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.30,0:03:41.30,Default,,0,0,0,,All we want to see is,

Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.94,0:03:47.08,Default,,0,0,0,,And maybe it’s best we can see this\Nin one example with the Chinese field.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.98,0:03:50.98,Default,,0,0,0,,So we look at all the congregations and groups
