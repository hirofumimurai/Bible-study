Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.41,0:00:24.61,Default,,0,0,0,,It says: \N“Now as they went on their way,

Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.96,0:01:17.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Did you note in verse 40, \Nit said that Martha
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.96,0:01:22.67,Default,,0,0,0,,“was distracted \Nwith attending to many duties”?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.50,0:01:27.67,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s quite likely that Martha \Nmay not have felt that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.67,0:01:31.07,Default,,0,0,0,,After all, she was not engaged \Nin some sort of hobby
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.07,0:01:33.08,Default,,0,0,0,,or materialistic pursuit,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.08,0:01:36.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and her duties were certainly not trivial.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.15,0:01:39.98,Default,,0,0,0,,She was tending to the needs of Jesus.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.49,0:01:47.06,Default,,0,0,0,,That had to be one of the greatest privileges
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.06,0:01:50.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and one of the greatest honors \Nan individual could have.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.16,0:01:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,So it’s no wonder that in verse 40
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.50,0:01:56.03,Default,,0,0,0,,she encourages Jesus \Nto tell her sister, Mary,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.03,0:01:58.77,Default,,0,0,0,,to come and help her.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.77,0:02:03.24,Default,,0,0,0,,But this raises an interesting question:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.24,0:02:06.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Is it possible for Christians today
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.34,0:02:09.21,Default,,0,0,0,,to become distracted

Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.92,0:02:17.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, consider three examples.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.35,0:02:19.82,Default,,0,0,0,,We want to do more in the ministry,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.82,0:02:23.43,Default,,0,0,0,,so we decide to learn a new language.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.43,0:02:28.20,Default,,0,0,0,,We focus on learning the language, \Nbut in the process,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.20,0:02:32.97,Default,,0,0,0,,we neglect time to read \Nand study the Bible in our mother tongue.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.27,0:02:39.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Or perhaps we decide we’re going to move \Nand serve where the need is greater,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.01,0:02:44.05,Default,,0,0,0,,and we begin to occupy so much \Nof our time in learning about the country
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.05,0:02:46.48,Default,,0,0,0,,—its customs and the food—
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.48,0:02:49.45,Default,,0,0,0,,that that begins to overshadow
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.45,0:02:52.46,Default,,0,0,0,,our family worship and personal study.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.69,0:02:56.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Or how about our Bethel assignment?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.19,0:02:58.19,Default,,0,0,0,,We love our assignment.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.19,0:02:59.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Our work is very interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.56,0:03:02.17,Default,,0,0,0,,We enjoy working hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.17,0:03:06.37,Default,,0,0,0,,But we become so absorbed \Nin staying ahead in our work
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.37,0:03:08.37,Default,,0,0,0,,and keeping things moving
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.37,0:03:13.21,Default,,0,0,0,,that we begin to do \Nself-imposed overtime work
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.21,0:03:15.38,Default,,0,0,0,,on a regular basis,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.38,0:03:17.91,Default,,0,0,0,,neglecting our meeting attendance
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.91,0:03:20.42,Default,,0,0,0,,and perhaps even time with our mate.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.72,0:03:23.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Did you notice that each situation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.72,0:03:27.89,Default,,0,0,0,,began as a worthwhile theocratic endeavor?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.89,0:03:30.99,Default,,0,0,0,,But can we see how it’s possible
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.99,0:03:33.90,Default,,0,0,0,,that each hypothetical situation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.90,0:03:36.90,Default,,0,0,0,,could become a realistic distraction?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.10,0:03:41.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, let’s just go back \Nfor a moment to the account in Luke
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.60,0:03:45.14,Default,,0,0,0,,because it’s important \Nto note that Jesus never said
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.14,0:03:48.65,Default,,0,0,0,,that what Martha was doing was wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.65,0:03:51.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Like our text mentioned, he loved Martha.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.25,0:03:52.85,Default,,0,0,0,,She was a spiritual woman,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.85,0:03:57.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and he was very appreciative \Nfor what she was doing in his behalf.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.02,0:04:01.52,Default,,0,0,0,,But he very kindly reminds her and shows her
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.52,0:04:04.33,Default,,0,0,0,,that her meal preparations \Nwere distracting her
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.33,0:04:07.80,Default,,0,0,0,,to the point \Nthat it interfered with her receiving
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.80,0:04:12.80,Default,,0,0,0,,what he refers to in verse 42 \Nas “the good portion”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.80,0:04:17.47,Default,,0,0,0,,—a spiritual activity, \Nlistening to his teachings.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.47,0:04:22.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Martha was not taking advantage \Nof a unique opportunity
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.11,0:04:24.78,Default,,0,0,0,,to deepen her faith.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.78,0:04:28.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Very interestingly, \Nthe September 1, 1999, Watchtower
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.25,0:04:32.59,Default,,0,0,0,,elaborates on this account, \Nand it makes this comment.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.59,0:04:34.99,Default,,0,0,0,,It says: \N“Moved by love, some [today]
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.99,0:04:38.16,Default,,0,0,0,,“—much like Martha— \Ndo their utmost to minister
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.16,0:04:40.23,Default,,0,0,0,,“to the needs of fellow believers.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.23,0:04:43.23,Default,,0,0,0,,“They are practical-minded \Nand quick to take action,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.23,0:04:47.34,Default,,0,0,0,,“and Jehovah promises \Nto reward their labors of love.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.34,0:04:51.64,Default,,0,0,0,,“Others perhaps more closely resemble Mary.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.64,0:04:54.14,Default,,0,0,0,,“They are quiet and contemplative.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.14,0:04:56.88,Default,,0,0,0,,“Their eagerness to meditate upon God’s Word
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.88,0:05:00.98,Default,,0,0,0,,helps them \Nto stay solidly rooted in the faith.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.98,0:05:04.02,Default,,0,0,0,,But then it says this:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.02,0:05:09.03,Default,,0,0,0,,“Both . . . fill a vital need \Nin the Christian congregation.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.03,0:05:13.33,Default,,0,0,0,,And by extension, \Nwe’ll just add in the Bethel family as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.33,0:05:15.73,Default,,0,0,0,,It continues: \N“In the end, however,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.73,0:05:18.27,Default,,0,0,0,,“all should ‘choose the good portion’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.27,0:05:21.70,Default,,0,0,0,,“by putting [spiritual or] primary emphasis
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.70,0:05:24.27,Default,,0,0,0,,on spiritual things.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.27,0:05:27.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that helps us \Nto see the balance, doesn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.34,0:05:30.55,Default,,0,0,0,,It makes me think, \Nperhaps in a modern-day application,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.55,0:05:34.48,Default,,0,0,0,,what if the circuit overseer \Ncame to visit our congregation
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.48,0:05:38.72,Default,,0,0,0,,and everyone wanted to go out \Nand work with him in the ministry,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.72,0:05:43.56,Default,,0,0,0,,but no one was willing to stop \Nand provide him with a meal?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.56,0:05:46.90,Default,,0,0,0,,That wouldn’t be good, \Nwould it, or hospitable?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.90,0:05:51.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Just like it wouldn’t be balanced \Nfor him to have multiple meal invitations,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.23,0:05:55.44,Default,,0,0,0,,and then no one showed up \Nto support him and his wife in the ministry.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.44,0:05:58.34,Default,,0,0,0,,So the point is, \Nwe want to make sure
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.34,0:06:01.31,Default,,0,0,0,,that we care for our needs \Nand the needs of others
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.31,0:06:06.32,Default,,0,0,0,,but also make sure \Nthat we remember our priorities.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.32,0:06:08.72,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what’s the key to ensuring
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.72,0:06:11.95,Default,,0,0,0,,that our endeavors \Nwill not become distractions?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.95,0:06:14.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, notice how the Bible explains this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.46,0:06:16.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Turn with me, please, \Nto Philippians chapter 1.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.23,0:06:23.90,Default,,0,0,0,,At Philippians chapter 1, \Nnotice verses 9 and 10:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.50,0:06:30.27,Default,,0,0,0,,“And this is what I continue praying,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.27,0:06:33.41,Default,,0,0,0,,“that your love \Nmay abound still more and more
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.41,0:06:35.98,Default,,0,0,0,,“with accurate knowledge \Nand full discernment;
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.98,0:06:39.82,Default,,0,0,0,,“that you may make sure \Nof the more important things,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.82,0:06:43.12,Default,,0,0,0,,“so that you may be flawless \Nand not stumbling others
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.12,0:06:45.79,Default,,0,0,0,,up to the day of Christ.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.79,0:06:50.59,Default,,0,0,0,,So before we undertake \Nany endeavor, any assignment,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.59,0:06:54.70,Default,,0,0,0,,you notice we want to pray, \Nreason things out,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.70,0:06:57.57,Default,,0,0,0,,use accurate knowledge, and discernment.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.57,0:07:01.77,Default,,0,0,0,,And if we’re able to use that insight \N—good judgment—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.77,0:07:06.11,Default,,0,0,0,,then it’s going to help us \Nto discern, or perceive,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.11,0:07:09.01,Default,,0,0,0,,what is most important to God.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.01,0:07:13.35,Default,,0,0,0,,And when we know that, \Nwell, then, we can harmonize our thoughts,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.35,0:07:16.52,Default,,0,0,0,,our actions, \Nand our decisions accordingly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.52,0:07:19.32,Default,,0,0,0,,By making sure \Nof the more important things,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.32,0:07:22.83,Default,,0,0,0,,we gain Jehovah’s blessing and favor.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.83,0:07:26.33,Default,,0,0,0,,So think about those situations we mentioned.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.33,0:07:28.46,Default,,0,0,0,,If we’re going to learn a new language
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.46,0:07:30.47,Default,,0,0,0,,or move where the need is greater,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.47,0:07:32.50,Default,,0,0,0,,well, that’s amazing!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.50,0:07:35.07,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s appreciated, and it’s definitely needed.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.07,0:07:38.41,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, we’re encouraged to do it \Nif we have the circumstances.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.41,0:07:42.81,Default,,0,0,0,,And, of course, in our Bethel assignment, \Nwho of us does not want to work hard,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.72,0:07:50.22,Default,,0,0,0,,But we can appreciate
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.22,0:07:54.09,Default,,0,0,0,,how Jesus shows us \Na valuable and balanced lesson

Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.09,0:08:01.13,Default,,0,0,0,,we should not let anything distract
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.13,0:08:04.27,Default,,0,0,0,,or impede our spiritual progress.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.27,0:08:07.97,Default,,0,0,0,,We don’t want to miss \Nopportunities to strengthen our faith,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.08,0:08:17.08,Default,,0,0,0,,If we just go back to Luke,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.08,0:08:21.02,Default,,0,0,0,,notice how Jesus \Nconcluded his words to Martha.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.02,0:08:23.15,Default,,0,0,0,,In verse 42, he says

Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.16,0:08:32.70,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what she learned that day

Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.87,0:08:38.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Mary would never forget that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.94,0:08:43.31,Default,,0,0,0,,That would stay with her \Nfor the rest of her life.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.31,0:08:48.31,Default,,0,0,0,,And likely, \Nwe can recall a similar account

Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.86,0:09:05.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, if you’ve had situations like that,
