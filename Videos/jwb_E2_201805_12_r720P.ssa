Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.30,0:00:19.97,Default,,0,0,0,,And isn’t it true \Nthat we see the same today? \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.78,0:00:35.95,Default,,0,0,0,,As we look at the attacks being made \Non Jehovah’s people around the world, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.95,0:00:38.42,Default,,0,0,0,,we think of our brothers in Eritrea, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.76,0:00:49.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Truly, Jesus’ words \Nare being fulfilled today. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.87,0:00:51.90,Default,,0,0,0,,But the question \Nwe want to consider today is, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.60,0:00:57.31,Default,,0,0,0,,See, the text says \Nthat ‘if they’ve persecuted me,’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.31,0:01:00.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus said, \N‘they will persecute you.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.98,0:01:04.25,Default,,0,0,0,,At 2 Timothy 3:12, it says: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.75,0:01:12.76,Default,,0,0,0,,So that means we’re not exempt. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.76,0:01:15.69,Default,,0,0,0,,And as our text highlights, \Nthings can quickly turn. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.69,0:01:19.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes it’s outright persecution \Nfrom governments \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.10,0:01:21.30,Default,,0,0,0,,or opposition from family members. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.30,0:01:24.57,Default,,0,0,0,,In other cases, \Nit may be efforts to block our work \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.31,0:01:31.54,Default,,0,0,0,,How will we do \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.45,0:01:38.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, it’s easy to say “Trust in Jehovah,” \Nand we know we need to do that. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.45,0:01:39.95,Default,,0,0,0,,But what does that mean? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.95,0:01:41.95,Default,,0,0,0,,How do we know what decisions to make? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.95,0:01:43.49,Default,,0,0,0,,What’s the right decision? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.49,0:01:45.12,Default,,0,0,0,,What’s not the right decision? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.12,0:01:48.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Are there principles that can guide us? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.39,0:01:50.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s consider three of them. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.76,0:01:54.53,Default,,0,0,0,,The first one is \Nthat the apparent easy solution \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.53,0:01:56.53,Default,,0,0,0,,out of a situation \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.53,0:01:59.27,Default,,0,0,0,,may not be the right solution. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.27,0:02:01.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Look in Isaiah chapter 30, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.74,0:02:06.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’ll look at a solution \Nthat the kings of Israel and Judah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.04,0:02:08.95,Default,,0,0,0,,fell back on from time to time. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.95,0:02:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Isaiah chapter 30, \Nand let’s read verses 1 and 2. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.45,0:02:16.62,Default,,0,0,0,,It says: \N“‘Woe to the stubborn sons,’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.62,0:02:18.62,Default,,0,0,0,,“declares Jehovah, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.62,0:02:22.33,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘who carry out plans that are not mine, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.14,0:02:38.07,Default,,0,0,0,,and to take refuge \Nin the shadow of Egypt!’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.07,0:02:40.98,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, the nation \Nthought it was a good solution \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.98,0:02:45.95,Default,,0,0,0,,to enlist Egypt’s aid \Nto keep off the Babylonians and others. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.95,0:02:49.62,Default,,0,0,0,,That seemed to be the best choice, \Nand we saw over and over again \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.62,0:02:52.76,Default,,0,0,0,,that the unfaithful kings \Nof Israel and Judah did that. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.76,0:02:55.86,Default,,0,0,0,,They chose to strike deals \Nwith Jehovah’s enemies \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.86,0:02:59.40,Default,,0,0,0,,to protect them \Nfrom other enemies of Jehovah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.40,0:03:03.87,Default,,0,0,0,,And so when under attack, \Nwhen facing opposition, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.87,0:03:07.40,Default,,0,0,0,,we too may be encouraged to strike a deal \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.40,0:03:11.31,Default,,0,0,0,,—maybe a bit of a compromise \Nto lessen the pressure. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.31,0:03:14.71,Default,,0,0,0,,But now, at other times, \Nwe notice that Paul and others \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.71,0:03:18.18,Default,,0,0,0,,did appeal to government officials \Nor appealed to Caesar, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.18,0:03:20.18,Default,,0,0,0,,and Jehovah blessed that. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.18,0:03:22.19,Default,,0,0,0,,So what’s the lesson? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.19,0:03:26.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the lesson is that we need \Nto make sure that we’re following a course \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.09,0:03:28.89,Default,,0,0,0,,that is in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.89,0:03:30.93,Default,,0,0,0,,and that is backed by his spirit. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.93,0:03:32.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So we need to prayerfully make sure \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.96,0:03:36.27,Default,,0,0,0,,that the arrangement \Nthat we’re working out is Jehovah’s will \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.27,0:03:39.70,Default,,0,0,0,,and to remember that the logical solution \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.70,0:03:41.74,Default,,0,0,0,,from man’s perspective \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.74,0:03:45.38,Default,,0,0,0,,may not always be Jehovah’s solution. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.38,0:03:47.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Second principle: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.41,0:03:51.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and that is not to become distracted \Nfrom our main focus and our main work. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.88,0:03:54.98,Default,,0,0,0,,And we have a good example of that \Nwhen considering Nehemiah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.98,0:03:58.42,Default,,0,0,0,,As we know, Nehemiah \Nwas blocked by enemies of Jehovah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.42,0:04:02.86,Default,,0,0,0,,who were trying to stop him \Nfrom completing his theocratic project. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.86,0:04:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Look, for example, at Nehemiah 6:2. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.96,0:04:10.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Nehemiah 6:2, and it says: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.10,0:04:14.10,Default,,0,0,0,,“Sanballat and Geshem \Nimmediately sent this message to me: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.10,0:04:17.17,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Come, and let us \Nset a time to meet together \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.17,0:04:19.64,Default,,0,0,0,,“in the villages of the Valley Plain of Ono.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.64,0:04:22.58,Default,,0,0,0,,But they were scheming to harm me.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.58,0:04:25.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, the distance between Jerusalem \Nand the Valley Plain of Ono \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.92,0:04:29.82,Default,,0,0,0,,was about 30 to 35 miles, \Nor about 50 kilometers, away. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.82,0:04:32.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Sanballat was not looking \Nto get together with Nehemiah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.39,0:04:34.39,Default,,0,0,0,,to work out how they could help them. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.39,0:04:37.79,Default,,0,0,0,,He was scheming to divert the work, \Nto slow down the work, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.79,0:04:41.36,Default,,0,0,0,,to oppose the work; \Nand Nehemiah knew what they were up to. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.36,0:04:44.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice what he says in verse 3. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.10,0:04:47.17,Default,,0,0,0,,He says: \N“I sent messengers to them, saying: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.17,0:04:51.67,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘I am engaged in a great work, \Nand I am not able to go down. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.67,0:04:55.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Why should the work stop \Nwhile I leave it to come to you?’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.71,0:04:57.71,Default,,0,0,0,,See, Nehemiah did not allow himself \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.71,0:05:00.68,Default,,0,0,0,,to become distracted \Nfrom his main assignment \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.68,0:05:03.35,Default,,0,0,0,,—from the work \Nthat he had been given to do. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.35,0:05:05.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, when that didn’t work, \Nhis opposers tried \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.66,0:05:07.79,Default,,0,0,0,,to get him to choose a solution \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.79,0:05:11.29,Default,,0,0,0,,that would harm his reputation \Nand bring reproach on Jehovah’s name. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.29,0:05:13.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Look over in verse 10. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.33,0:05:15.33,Default,,0,0,0,,See, this says: \N‘Well, come into the temple. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.33,0:05:18.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s shut the doors of the temple \Nbecause they’re coming to kill you.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.67,0:05:20.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, look at verse 13. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.77,0:05:25.21,Default,,0,0,0,,He says: “He had been hired \Nto frighten me and to cause me to sin, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.21,0:05:28.71,Default,,0,0,0,,“so that they would have grounds \Nto damage my reputation \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.71,0:05:31.55,Default,,0,0,0,,in order to reproach me.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.55,0:05:34.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Well see, likewise, \Nat times we may be offered \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.18,0:05:38.32,Default,,0,0,0,,solutions out of a situation \Nor to relieve pressure from opposition \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.32,0:05:40.32,Default,,0,0,0,,which will distract us \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.32,0:05:43.43,Default,,0,0,0,,from our primary work \N—our service to Jehovah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.43,0:05:46.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Or it may be an initiative \Nthat’s a little bit in a gray area. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.60,0:05:49.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, everybody does it, \Nbut it’s a gray area. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.57,0:05:53.34,Default,,0,0,0,,And it could damage our reputation \Nor bring reproach on Jehovah’s name. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.34,0:05:55.10,Default,,0,0,0,,So again, what do we do? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.10,0:05:57.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Will we seek Jehovah’s direction? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.11,0:06:02.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Will this solution distract us \Nfrom our main commission? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.11,0:06:04.28,Default,,0,0,0,,How will it appear to onlookers? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.28,0:06:07.52,Default,,0,0,0,,What will it do to Jehovah’s name? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.52,0:06:11.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, these first two principles \Ndo not mean that we do not do anything; \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.39,0:06:13.72,Default,,0,0,0,,and that leads to our third principle. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.72,0:06:17.83,Default,,0,0,0,,And that is we do what we can \Nfrom a practical standpoint. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.83,0:06:22.07,Default,,0,0,0,,We give Jehovah something to bless, \Nand then we wait on Jehovah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.07,0:06:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And the account of Hezekiah \Nis a beautiful example of that. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.00,0:06:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,We had the drama \Nat our convention this year, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.90,0:06:32.48,Default,,0,0,0,,where the ruthless king of Assyria \Nwas determined to take Jerusalem. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.48,0:06:36.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Rabshakeh taunted Hezekiah \Nand tried to get the people to surrender \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.71,0:06:39.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and make a deal with Assyria. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.56,0:06:50.16,Default,,0,0,0,,He did what he could \Nto give Jehovah something to bless. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.16,0:06:51.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Remember what they did? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.53,0:06:55.26,Default,,0,0,0,,They went and diverted \Nthe water sources outside the city \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.26,0:06:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,so that if there was a siege, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.00,0:06:59.47,Default,,0,0,0,,the Assyrians \Nwould have trouble getting water. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.47,0:07:02.61,Default,,0,0,0,,They strengthened the city’s fortification \N—the walls. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.61,0:07:05.61,Default,,0,0,0,,They made missiles in abundance and shields. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.61,0:07:09.38,Default,,0,0,0,,They did what they could, \Nbut they trusted in Jehovah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.38,0:07:14.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Remember what Hezekiah said to the people \Nas recorded at 2 Chronicles 32:7, 8? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.35,0:07:16.15,Default,,0,0,0,,He says: \N“Be courageous and strong. . . . \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.79,0:07:22.33,Default,,0,0,0,,So they did what they could, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.33,0:07:25.23,Default,,0,0,0,,but they relied on Jehovah \Nfor the real solution. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.23,0:07:26.86,Default,,0,0,0,,And interestingly, in this case, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.86,0:07:29.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah did not use \Nanything of what they did. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.13,0:07:32.60,Default,,0,0,0,,He provided an angel to deliver them. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.60,0:07:35.97,Default,,0,0,0,,So likewise, \Nwhen facing persecution today, \N
