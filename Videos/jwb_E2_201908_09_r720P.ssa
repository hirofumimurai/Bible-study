Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.51,0:04:17.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Joseph meditated on that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.51,0:04:21.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Likely, he meditated on what happened\Nto his great-grandfather Abram,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.44,0:04:26.31,Default,,0,0,0,,in chapter 12, as Abram and Sarai
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.32,0:04:30.56,Default,,0,0,0,,traveled to Egypt—Genesis 12:17.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.55,0:04:32.55,Default,,0,0,0,,This account tells us that Abram failed

Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.84,0:04:52.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Later in chapter 20, Abraham and Sarah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.68,0:04:54.85,Default,,0,0,0,,went to the land of Gerar
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.84,0:04:57.61,Default,,0,0,0,,and employed a similar strategy;
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.61,0:04:59.65,Default,,0,0,0,,they didn’t reveal that they were married.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.65,0:05:03.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And the king of Gerar, Abimelech,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.12,0:05:07.19,Default,,0,0,0,,had this experience at Genesis 20:3:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.19,0:05:09.33,Default,,0,0,0,,“Afterward, God came by night

Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.54,0:05:26.18,Default,,0,0,0,,And Abimelech said to Jehovah,\N‘Listen, I didn’t know.’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.18,0:05:28.35,Default,,0,0,0,,And Jehovah said,\N‘I know you didn’t know.’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.34,0:05:32.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And so he says in verse 6 at the end:

Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.16,0:05:44.66,Default,,0,0,0,,“Sinning against me”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.66,0:05:48.00,Default,,0,0,0,,—Joseph undoubtedly meditated on that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.00,0:05:51.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Then, at Genesis 26:10,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.33,0:05:55.07,Default,,0,0,0,,his grandfather Isaac\Nand his grandmother Rebecca
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.07,0:05:57.17,Default,,0,0,0,,also went to Gerar.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.17,0:05:59.57,Default,,0,0,0,,They also met a man named Abimelech,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.58,0:06:02.58,Default,,0,0,0,,likely a successor\Nof the Abimelech mentioned in chapter 20,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.58,0:06:04.58,Default,,0,0,0,,and they too didn’t tell Abimelech
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.58,0:06:06.78,Default,,0,0,0,,that they were married,\Nbut the king found out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.78,0:06:10.18,Default,,0,0,0,,And so at Genesis 26:10:

Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.13,0:06:24.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Undoubtedly, Joseph meditated on that.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.80,0:06:29.74,Default,,0,0,0,,The principle recorded at Genesis 2:24
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.74,0:06:33.54,Default,,0,0,0,,again came into play\N—a man, his wife, one flesh.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.01,0:06:38.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Shechem was not yet married to Dinah,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.86,0:07:27.66,Default,,0,0,0,,It wasn’t just\Nan intellectual exercise for Joseph.
