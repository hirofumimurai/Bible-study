Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.15,0:06:10.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎This is possible, in part,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.49,0:06:14.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎because the text \Nis not cluttered with too many words
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.49,0:06:18.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—trying to copy \Nthe Hebrew syntax and style of expression. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.83,0:06:21.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Thus, the use of modern language
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.56,0:06:24.56,Default,,0,0,0,,‎contributes to naturalness and clarity.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.54,0:06:30.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The language used

Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.88,0:06:45.09,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Like in Matthew 11,\Nwhen Jesus invites us to take his yoke upon us,

Dialogue: 0,0:22:54.12,0:22:57.62,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Let’s scrutinize these clues. 
Dialogue: 0,0:22:57.63,0:22:59.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The first clue is,

Dialogue: 0,0:23:03.53,0:23:05.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎where the title “Lord” appears
Dialogue: 0,0:23:05.53,0:23:08.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎in quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures
Dialogue: 0,0:23:08.00,0:23:10.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that originally used the divine name. 
Dialogue: 0,0:23:10.87,0:23:13.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The second clue is
Dialogue: 0,0:23:13.01,0:23:16.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎where the Greek text contains a Hebrew idiom
Dialogue: 0,0:23:16.38,0:23:19.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that would normally contain the divine name. 
Dialogue: 0,0:23:19.21,0:23:22.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎For example, \Nif someone says in English,

Dialogue: 0,0:23:29.49,0:23:33.13,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes, the expression is “skin of his teeth.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:23:33.13,0:23:36.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎This is similar with Hebrew expressions. 
Dialogue: 0,0:23:36.33,0:23:39.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Some of these contain the divine name. 
Dialogue: 0,0:23:39.30,0:23:43.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎For example, \Nthe expression found at Matthew 1:20
Dialogue: 0,0:23:43.34,0:23:47.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is “the angel of Jehovah.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:23:47.01,0:23:50.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So whenever we find \Na Greek translation of a Hebrew idiom

Dialogue: 0,0:23:52.95,0:23:56.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎this is another clue \Nthat Jehovah’s name should be there.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:57.95,0:23:59.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The third clue
Dialogue: 0,0:23:59.96,0:24:02.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is where the term “Lord” appears

Dialogue: 0,0:24:07.70,0:24:12.04,Default,,0,0,0,,‎An example of this is Matthew 1:22:

Dialogue: 0,0:24:33.99,0:24:35.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The fourth clue
Dialogue: 0,0:24:35.99,0:24:38.13,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is when we see in the Greek text
Dialogue: 0,0:24:38.13,0:24:43.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎where there is no definite article \Nbefore Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord,”
Dialogue: 0,0:24:43.00,0:24:47.97,Default,,0,0,0,,‎in places where the Greek grammar\Nnormally expects a definite article. 
Dialogue: 0,0:24:47.97,0:24:52.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎This clue may indicate \Nthat a proper name, such as Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.57,0:24:54.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎originally was there in the text
Dialogue: 0,0:24:54.71,0:24:59.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and was removed from later manuscripts\Nand replaced with Kyʹri·os. 
Dialogue: 0,0:24:59.71,0:25:03.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎To illustrate the importance of this clue,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:03.02,0:25:06.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎imagine that you are a newspaper reporter

Dialogue: 0,0:25:24.57,0:25:28.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So you are told to remove\Nhis name from the report.

Dialogue: 0,0:25:50.17,0:25:52.97,Default,,0,0,0,,‎That’s because you suppressed the name
