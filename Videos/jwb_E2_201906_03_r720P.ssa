Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.60,0:02:09.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and sadly, it lasted until 1990.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.15,0:02:12.28,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s amazing!\NSo that’s 40 years under ban.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.55,0:02:40.14,Default,,0,0,0,,My parents were contacted by the Witnesses

Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.14,0:02:45.77,Default,,0,0,0,,so my sister and I were also raised in the truth.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.77,0:02:47.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So this is very interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.19,0:02:52.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Often, we have talked about brothers\Nwho were faithful under ban who were adults,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.69,0:02:56.32,Default,,0,0,0,,but you were children while\Nthe ban was going on, and you stayed faithful.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.32,0:02:59.41,Default,,0,0,0,,So, Delia, do you remember what it was like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.41,0:03:01.75,Default,,0,0,0,,going to meetings under ban?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.74,0:03:04.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, we met secretly in small groups.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.17,0:03:09.80,Default,,0,0,0,,but once everyone was inside the home,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.79,0:03:11.79,Default,,0,0,0,,we would lock the gate and the door
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.80,0:03:13.97,Default,,0,0,0,,and pull down all of the shades.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.96,0:03:17.21,Default,,0,0,0,,The meetings were moved\Nto a different location each week.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.22,0:03:18.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Very interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.22,0:03:20.31,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, it must have been, though,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.30,0:03:23.14,Default,,0,0,0,,that you probably had to miss\Na lot of meetings under ban.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.14,0:03:26.89,Default,,0,0,0,,No, no—we didn’t want to miss\Nany opportunity to meet together.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.89,0:03:29.85,Default,,0,0,0,,But weren’t you frightened in these meetings
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.86,0:03:31.86,Default,,0,0,0,,(where you’d pulled down all the shades)
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.86,0:03:34.03,Default,,0,0,0,,that you might be discovered or arrested?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.03,0:03:37.70,Default,,0,0,0,,You might think so, but the opposite was true.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.70,0:03:40.62,Default,,0,0,0,,I felt the most safe when we were all together.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.62,0:03:42.62,Default,,0,0,0,,You could feel Jehovah’s protection.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.62,0:03:44.62,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s very touching.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.62,0:03:48.79,Default,,0,0,0,,So, Ionuţ, did you and Delia\Nknow each other growing up?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.79,0:03:52.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, we grew up in the same town, Negreşti-Oaş,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.71,0:03:55.25,Default,,0,0,0,,so our families knew each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.26,0:03:58.64,Default,,0,0,0,,So did your families, then,\Noccasionally attend the same meetings?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.63,0:04:01.80,Default,,0,0,0,,No, we didn’t.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.80,0:04:03.84,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, my family was
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.85,0:04:06.27,Default,,0,0,0,,in a separate group from Delia’s family.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.27,0:04:08.27,Default,,0,0,0,,In a separate group?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.27,0:04:10.27,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, explain what you mean.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.27,0:04:13.23,Default,,0,0,0,,You might remember Brother Lösch’s video
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.23,0:04:16.15,Default,,0,0,0,,from the 2018 annual meeting.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.15,0:04:18.99,Default,,0,0,0,,He explained how government spies

Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.53,0:04:25.20,Default,,0,0,0,,and this made it difficult to know who to trust.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.20,0:04:28.08,Default,,0,0,0,,This caused the Witnesses to separate
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.08,0:04:30.25,Default,,0,0,0,,into two large groups
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.25,0:04:32.50,Default,,0,0,0,,—one group stayed in contact
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.50,0:04:35.13,Default,,0,0,0,,with world headquarters in Brooklyn,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.13,0:04:37.47,Default,,0,0,0,,and the other did not.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.46,0:04:40.67,Default,,0,0,0,,But both groups continued to worship Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.68,0:04:41.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Amazing!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.68,0:04:44.81,Default,,0,0,0,,So you grew up\N—both of you as Jehovah’s Witnesses
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.81,0:04:47.35,Default,,0,0,0,,but associating with different groups.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.35,0:04:51.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, did one group view\Nthe other group as apostates?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.40,0:04:53.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Generally, no.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.40,0:04:56.78,Default,,0,0,0,,We didn’t see the other group as apostates.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.78,0:04:59.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Our beliefs were essentially the same.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.03,0:05:02.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, I should mention that when I was small,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.99,0:05:06.33,Default,,0,0,0,,I remember my mother\Nstayed up one night studying.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.33,0:05:09.63,Default,,0,0,0,,After all night of study,\Nmeditation, and prayer,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.62,0:05:13.25,Default,,0,0,0,,she decided to switch to the group\Nconnected to the main organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.25,0:05:18.01,Default,,0,0,0,,So that’s why I grew up as a part of the group\Nassociated with the main organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.01,0:05:21.26,Default,,0,0,0,,My, it sounds like your mother\Nwas very conscientious
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.26,0:05:24.05,Default,,0,0,0,,and set a really good example for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.05,0:05:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,I deeply appreciate her and my grandparents
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.22,0:05:30.18,Default,,0,0,0,,for being faithful examples and good teachers.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.18,0:05:33.14,Default,,0,0,0,,OK, when you say good teachers,\Nwhat do you mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.15,0:05:38.11,Default,,0,0,0,,For example, we kept beehives in our garden;
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.11,0:05:41.78,Default,,0,0,0,,my mother helped us to see how\NJehovah made them to be industrious.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.78,0:05:45.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Then she drew the lesson\Nthat we could be industrious like the bees,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.57,0:05:48.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and in spite of the ban,\Nwe could stay busy serving Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.95,0:05:53.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Those must be some cherished memories,\Nthose lessons like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.04,0:05:54.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, I wonder.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.33,0:05:58.42,Default,,0,0,0,,At meetings, since the literature was banned,\Nwhat did you study?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.42,0:06:03.43,Default,,0,0,0,,At meetings, usually there was one copy\Nof The Watchtower for the whole group.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.43,0:06:05.89,Default,,0,0,0,,When the paragraph was read,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.89,0:06:09.06,Default,,0,0,0,,we would listen and answer the question from memory.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.06,0:06:13.19,Default,,0,0,0,,My goodness, you had\Nto pay really close attention at the meetings.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.19,0:06:16.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Were there ever times\Nwhen you could get together in larger groups?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.15,0:06:21.03,Default,,0,0,0,,We couldn’t have assemblies and conventions,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.03,0:06:24.08,Default,,0,0,0,,but we could have funerals,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.07,0:06:27.16,Default,,0,0,0,,weddings, picnics.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.16,0:06:29.58,Default,,0,0,0,,These became our assemblies and conventions.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.58,0:06:32.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes, a funeral could have

Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.58,0:06:37.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and it could last up to four hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.00,0:06:38.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Wow!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.00,0:06:39.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what about songs?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.75,0:06:42.46,Default,,0,0,0,,The songbook would have been part\Nof the banned literature.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.51,0:06:52.51,Default,,0,0,0,,We enjoyed that; it was entertainment for us.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.52,0:06:54.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So you memorized the songs?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.52,0:06:57.15,Default,,0,0,0,,So if someone called out a song number,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.15,0:06:59.36,Default,,0,0,0,,you could sing the song from memory?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.36,0:07:03.40,Default,,0,0,0,,What was going to school like under ban?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.62,0:07:19.00,Default,,0,0,0,,We just hid the things

Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.63,0:07:27.38,Default,,0,0,0,,So you must have been very determined

Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.59,0:07:31.93,Default,,0,0,0,,So whatever happened to the two groups?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.70,0:07:51.70,Default,,0,0,0,,True.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.70,0:07:55.41,Default,,0,0,0,,But I learned a lesson I never want to forget:
