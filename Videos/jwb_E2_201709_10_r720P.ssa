Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.71,0:03:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s consider Moses. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.88,0:03:49.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah gave him tremendous authority. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.18,0:03:53.65,Default,,0,0,0,,And it’s known that power, \Nauthority, a responsible position \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.30,0:04:09.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and verse 25 says that Jehovah \Ntook some of the spirit of Moses away \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.90,0:04:11.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and put it on the 70 elders, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.90,0:04:14.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and they began to behave as prophets. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.14,0:04:16.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, \Nthere’s nothing that indicates Moses \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.71,0:04:20.74,Default,,0,0,0,,jealously tried to guard \Nhis authority and privileges. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.74,0:04:22.75,Default,,0,0,0,,He was humble.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.75,0:04:26.75,Default,,0,0,0,,And we all remember the account \Nwhere Moses’ father-in-law \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.02,0:04:38.03,Default,,0,0,0,,He humbly accepted the suggestion. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.03,0:04:40.03,Default,,0,0,0,,And then later, \Nat the end of his life \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.03,0:04:43.57,Default,,0,0,0,,when Jehovah chose his replacement\N—Joshua—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.57,0:04:45.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Moses humbly accepted that decision. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.96,0:05:46.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, they got under Moses’ skin. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.43,0:05:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,They caused him \Nto lose his humility momentarily. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.57,0:05:53.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Look at verse 9: \N
