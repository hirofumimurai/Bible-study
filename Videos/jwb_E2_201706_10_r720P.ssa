Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.70,0:00:20.90,Default,,0,0,0,,is perhaps related the closest \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.90,0:00:24.41,Default,,0,0,0,,to our being able to gain \Nthe prize of everlasting life? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.41,0:00:26.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, is it not hearing?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.58,0:00:29.41,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s interesting that throughout history, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.41,0:00:33.58,Default,,0,0,0,,the churches of Babylon the Great \Nhave put the main emphasis, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.58,0:00:38.59,Default,,0,0,0,,not on hearing, \Nbut on seeing or perhaps touching\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.59,0:00:43.59,Default,,0,0,0,,—seeing an image of their God, \Nmaybe touching or kissing that image. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.59,0:00:48.10,Default,,0,0,0,,But Jehovah has always put\Nthe emphasis on hearing.\N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.65,0:01:10.69,Default,,0,0,0,,But now, here’s a question: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.69,0:01:13.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Is it sufficient that we just hear \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.04,0:01:37.11,Default,,0,0,0,,And he proceeded with his presentation. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.11,0:01:40.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, he heard sounds \Ncoming out of her mouth, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.25,0:01:44.79,Default,,0,0,0,,but he didn’t hear \Nso as to perceive what was said.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.79,0:01:46.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, obviously,\NJehovah expects us to do\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.92,0:01:50.73,Default,,0,0,0,,a whole lot better than that \Nwhen it comes to hearing his words. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.73,0:01:55.06,Default,,0,0,0,,At Matthew 13:16, \Ntoday’s scripture text, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.06,0:01:58.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus commended his disciples \Nby saying: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.71,0:02:04.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, he wasn’t commending them \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.18,0:02:11.82,Default,,0,0,0,,but he was commending them \Nbecause they heard with understanding. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.82,0:02:13.82,Default,,0,0,0,,They grasped the meaning, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.82,0:02:18.45,Default,,0,0,0,,and then they were in a position \Nto make application of what they had heard. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.45,0:02:21.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, do we want Jehovah and Jesus \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.19,0:02:24.56,Default,,0,0,0,,to pronounce our ears happy? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.56,0:02:27.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Do we want figuratively happy ears? \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.33,0:02:32.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, then, we must listen\N—like those disciples—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.14,0:02:34.80,Default,,0,0,0,,in a way that we grasp the meaning \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.80,0:02:37.57,Default,,0,0,0,,and are in a position to make application.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.57,0:02:40.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Open up to Mark chapter 4, please. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.41,0:02:43.48,Default,,0,0,0,,And here’s an interesting scripture \Nin this vein. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.48,0:02:45.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice the words of Jesus. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.78,0:02:50.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Mark chapter 4, \Nbeginning in verse 23, he said: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.03,0:02:58.03,Default,,0,0,0,,“He further said to them: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.03,0:03:00.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‘Pay attention to what you are hearing.’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.60,0:03:02.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Now notice this: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.17,0:03:04.53,Default,,0,0,0,,“With the measure \Nthat you are measuring out, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.53,0:03:06.77,Default,,0,0,0,,“you will have it measured out to you, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.77,0:03:09.77,Default,,0,0,0,,yes, you will have more added to you.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.77,0:03:12.41,Default,,0,0,0,,So notice, Jesus was saying \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.41,0:03:16.18,Default,,0,0,0,,that if you measure out\Nlittle interest and attention,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.18,0:03:18.85,Default,,0,0,0,,don’t expect to gain much. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.85,0:03:21.02,Default,,0,0,0,,In contrast, \Nif you measure out \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.02,0:03:29.03,Default,,0,0,0,,then I will give you generously, \Neven beyond your expectations. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.03,0:03:31.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it works the same way today,\Ndoesn’t it?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.29,0:03:35.97,Default,,0,0,0,,We actually reap enlightenment \Nin direct proportion \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.97,0:03:39.54,Default,,0,0,0,,to how much interest \Nand attention we measure out.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.54,0:03:41.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Go to Hebrews chapter 2. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.54,0:03:45.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Here’s another scripture— \Nvery familiar scripture in this regard\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.98,0:03:48.11,Default,,0,0,0,,—Hebrews chapter 2, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.11,0:03:52.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and notice that we’re not \Nto just pay casual attention \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.28,0:03:54.62,Default,,0,0,0,,or even usual attention, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.62,0:03:56.62,Default,,0,0,0,,but notice how it’s worded. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.62,0:03:58.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Hebrews 2:1: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.69,0:04:03.03,Default,,0,0,0,,“That is why it is necessary for us to pay \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.03,0:04:06.36,Default,,0,0,0,,“more than the usual attention \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.36,0:04:08.36,Default,,0,0,0,,“to the things we have heard, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.36,0:04:10.87,Default,,0,0,0,,so that we never drift away.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.87,0:04:12.87,Default,,0,0,0,,So it’s absolutely required \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.87,0:04:15.57,Default,,0,0,0,,that if we’re not going to drift \Naway from Jehovah or the truth, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.57,0:04:19.58,Default,,0,0,0,,we’ve got \N“to pay more than the usual attention.”\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.58,0:04:21.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, let’s illustrate this point. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.78,0:04:23.78,Default,,0,0,0,,I’d like you to imagine \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.05,0:04:32.39,Default,,0,0,0,,A fireman makes his way to you, \Nand he says: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.39,0:04:36.26,Default,,0,0,0,,“I only have time to tell you this once; \NI’ve got to go help other people. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.00,0:05:50.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that’s how we want to listen. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.85,0:07:16.05,Default,,0,0,0,,And, apparently, \Nit comes from the fact \N
