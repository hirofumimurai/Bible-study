Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.72,0:00:03.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎What do you need? 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.85,0:00:06.15,Default,,0,0,0,,‎What do you want? 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.16,0:00:08.26,Default,,0,0,0,,‎There’s a big difference between things
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.26,0:00:10.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that are absolutely necessary
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.89,0:00:12.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and things that we might enjoy
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.93,0:00:14.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or things that would make our life
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.66,0:00:19.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎a little more comfortable,\Neven though they’re not essential. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.07,0:00:24.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In 1956, a newspaper columnist \Nmade an interesting observation. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.07,0:00:28.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He estimated that 100 years earlier, in 1856,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.31,0:00:31.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎man basically had 72 wants,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.68,0:00:35.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎ of which only 16 were necessities,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.19,0:00:38.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and men of that day \Nwere being urged by advertisers
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.69,0:00:41.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to buy about 200 items. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.99,0:00:44.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But by 1956,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.33,0:00:48.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the number of wants had grown to 474,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.20,0:00:52.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of which 94 were viewed as necessities,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.37,0:00:54.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and men were being bombarded with ads
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.80,0:00:58.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to buy about 32,000 articles. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.91,0:01:01.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The columnist’s conclusion:
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.44,0:01:04.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Man’s necessities are few;
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.61,0:01:07.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎his wants, infinite. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.78,0:01:10.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, if he’d made the same estimates today,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.09,0:01:12.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I’m sure the figures would be a lot higher. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.69,0:01:15.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The commercial world constantly pressures us
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.89,0:01:20.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎not only to buy things\Nbut to view as necessities
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.46,0:01:24.97,Default,,0,0,0,,‎things that should really be classified as wants.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.97,0:01:29.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Seeing the clear difference \Nbetween our needs and our wants
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.91,0:01:34.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is a key to avoiding the snare of materialism,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.91,0:01:38.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and we appreciate the frequent reminders
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.08,0:01:41.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that we receive \Nfrom “the faithful and discreet slave.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.08,0:01:45.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎These help us to have \Nthe proper view of material things. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.59,0:01:48.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎For example, \Nthe text today is taken from an article
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.59,0:01:53.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that had the very clear title \N“Seek the Kingdom, Not Things.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.60,0:01:58.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And the theme scripture \Nwas Luke 12:31, where it says:
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.00,0:02:03.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Keep seeking his Kingdom, \Nand these things will be added to you.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.14,0:02:08.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It’s essential \Nthat we have faith in those words. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.65,0:02:12.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We fully trust \Nthat Jehovah is going to provide
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.05,0:02:14.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for our physical needs
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.05,0:02:18.56,Default,,0,0,0,,‎as long as we put \Nhis worship first in our lives. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.56,0:02:22.20,Default,,0,0,0,,‎There was a simple definition \Nof materialism in the study article;
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.19,0:02:24.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎it’s found in paragraph 3. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.19,0:02:27.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, it didn’t say that materialism \Nis having a large bank account,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.70,0:02:31.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‎living in a big house, \Nor driving a fancy automobile. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.60,0:02:33.60,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Rather, it said:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.60,0:02:37.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘Materialism is the preoccupation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.41,0:02:39.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘with material things
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.41,0:02:42.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎rather than with spiritual riches.’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.88,0:02:46.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So materialism really is a condition
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.68,0:02:49.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of our mind and our heart. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.42,0:02:51.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So it’s good to ask ourselves:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.82,0:02:54.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘What am I constantly thinking about? 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.29,0:02:58.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎When I get together with my friends, \Nwhat is the subject of our conversation?’
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.83,0:03:01.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎As our commenters pointed out,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.93,0:03:04.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the spirit of materialism can infect anyone
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.83,0:03:08.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—even pioneers, even Bethelites. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.37,0:03:11.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It infected Christians in the first century. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.31,0:03:14.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Please open your Bibles to Revelation chapter 3,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.74,0:03:18.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and we’ll notice here \Nthat apparently many in the congregation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.68,0:03:23.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎had become contaminated \Nby the materialistic environment
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.59,0:03:25.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎in the city of Laodicea. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.82,0:03:29.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And notice the strong counsel that Jesus gave
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.06,0:03:33.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to those who were putting \Ntheir trust in material riches. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.63,0:03:37.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Revelation 3:17 says:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.93,0:03:39.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Because you say,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.94,0:03:44.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“‘I am rich and have acquired riches\Nand do not need anything at all,’
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.94,0:03:48.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“but you do not know that you are miserable
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.11,0:03:52.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and pitiful and poor and blind and naked.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.25,0:03:55.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, were these Christians materially rich? 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.75,0:03:57.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.35,0:04:00.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But Jesus said they were in spiritual poverty. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.69,0:04:02.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Did they wear fine clothing? 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.69,0:04:04.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎No doubt. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.46,0:04:07.56,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But in Jesus’ eyes, they were naked,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.13,0:04:15.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎so we can see that they \Nwere in a bad spiritual state.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.14,0:04:19.28,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Was there any cure \Nfor the Laodicean’s spiritual sickness? 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.28,0:04:20.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.38,0:04:23.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Look back at chapter 3 \Nand the first part of verse 18. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.81,0:04:27.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Interestingly, Jesus told them that the remedy
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.95,0:04:31.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for trusting in riches was to ‘buy gold.’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.65,0:04:33.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But what kind of gold? 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.89,0:04:35.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎He said: “I advise you
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.99,0:04:40.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“to buy from me gold refined by fire
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.36,0:04:42.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎so that you may become rich.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.90,0:04:47.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes, spiritual riches are what are important. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.10,0:04:50.50,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Only spiritual treasures are lasting. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.51,0:04:53.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Material possessions \Nare merely a means to an end. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.51,0:04:55.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We need them to keep on living,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.51,0:04:58.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and we need them \Nto carry out our worship of Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.65,0:05:00.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So we need to ask ourselves:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.92,0:05:03.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘What are my priorities? 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.22,0:05:06.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Where is my focus?’ 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.22,0:05:09.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Sally and I found ourselves \Nasking these questions
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.36,0:05:11.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎during a recent branch visit. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.73,0:05:13.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We met brothers in countries
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.73,0:05:17.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎where the Kingdom work \Nis under various degrees of restriction. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.83,0:05:19.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They have no witnessing carts. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.84,0:05:22.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They can’t offer literature door to door. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.21,0:05:24.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In one country, brothers can be arrested
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.37,0:05:28.27,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and fined the equivalent of six weeks’ wages
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.28,0:05:31.15,Default,,0,0,0,,‎just for witnessing in public. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.15,0:05:34.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In some places, police would confiscate \Nyour phone or your tablet
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.92,0:05:39.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎if they found that it contained \Nthe JW Library® app. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.02,0:05:43.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In another country, when police \Nwould find JW Library® on your device,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.86,0:05:45.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎they would just erase the app
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.86,0:05:48.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and then give the device \Nback to the publisher. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.73,0:05:52.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But in spite of these obstacles and threats,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.30,0:05:56.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎our brothers are finding \Ntrue joy in serving Jehovah. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.64,0:05:59.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And you can imagine,\Nit was inspiring
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.11,0:06:02.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to be able to work \Nwith them during this time. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.08,0:06:04.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In one country, \Nwe met with circuit overseers
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.75,0:06:06.85,Default,,0,0,0,,‎from three different language groups. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.85,0:06:11.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I asked them the question, \N“What do our brothers need most?” 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.79,0:06:16.80,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In unison, they immediately replied,\N“Armageddon.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.43,0:06:22.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎That really put things in perspective for me. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.83,0:06:27.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎These brothers \Nare not preoccupied with material things. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.54,0:06:32.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎For them, \Nevery day is a matter of spiritual survival. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.34,0:06:38.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Stay faithful, \Nmeet regularly, and preach informally
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.18,0:06:43.09,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—these are the most important things, \Nthe things that really matter. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.09,0:06:48.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So how fitting is the reminder \Nat Proverbs 11:4, where it says:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.09,0:06:51.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.29,0:06:55.96,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but righteousness \Nis what will rescue from death”! 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.97,0:06:59.84,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes, we may have some possessions \Nthat we view as very valuable. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.84,0:07:01.04,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We may treasure them. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.04,0:07:04.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Maybe it’s something \Nwe received as a family heirloom,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.07,0:07:07.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but we should not expect \Nthat any of our possessions,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.54,0:07:11.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‎regardless of how treasured \Nor how valuable they may be,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.51,0:07:15.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎will survive with us \Nthrough the great tribulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.75,0:07:20.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Please open your Bibles \Nto Jeremiah chapter 45. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.49,0:07:22.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We’re going to read verse 5,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.49,0:07:26.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and this scripture will help us to maintain \Nthe proper viewpoint
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.50,0:07:28.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of material things. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.70,0:07:33.14,Default,,0,0,0,,‎These are words that were directed \Nto Jeremiah’s secretary, Baruch. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.14,0:07:35.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Jeremiah 45:5 says:

Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.46,0:07:55.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Whether these “great things” \NBaruch was seeking
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.86,0:07:59.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎were material possessions, \Nwe do not know. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.40,0:08:04.04,Default,,0,0,0,,‎What we do know \Nis that when the great tribulation breaks out,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.77,0:08:15.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And whether we survive \Nthat great tribulation or not,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.34,0:08:20.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎could very well depend on how \Nwe answer these two questions right now:
