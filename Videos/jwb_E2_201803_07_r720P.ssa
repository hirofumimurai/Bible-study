Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.06,0:00:10.09,Default,,0,0,0,,those in the Ephesian congregation \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.09,0:00:12.16,Default,,0,0,0,,about examining themselves. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.81,0:00:48.82,Default,,0,0,0,,So it’s very clear to us, \Nin this chapter of Ephesians chapter 5, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.38,0:04:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,We can also talk to the elders\N—our loving shepherds—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.00,0:04:15.82,Default,,0,0,0,,who will pray with us,\Nand they will definitely help us \N
