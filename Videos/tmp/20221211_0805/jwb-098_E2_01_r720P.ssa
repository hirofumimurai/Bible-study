Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.70,0:03:37.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, if you turn back\Njust a couple of chapters,

Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.90,0:03:44.94,Default,,0,0,0,,you’ll notice in verses 5 and 6\Nthat when Jesus sent out his apostles,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.94,0:03:46.94,Default,,0,0,0,,what did he say to them?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.94,0:03:50.58,Default,,0,0,0,,“Do not go off into the road of the nations,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.58,0:03:54.32,Default,,0,0,0,,“and do not enter any Samaritan city;
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.32,0:03:57.75,Default,,0,0,0,,“but instead, go continually

Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.86,0:04:04.69,Default,,0,0,0,,So as Jesus sent out his apostles

Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.96,0:04:09.53,Default,,0,0,0,,what was he reminding them of?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.53,0:04:11.03,Default,,0,0,0,,He was telling them

Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.44,0:04:16.17,Default,,0,0,0,,a specific assignment.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.17,0:04:17.94,Default,,0,0,0,,They weren’t supposed to try
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.94,0:04:19.31,Default,,0,0,0,,and do everything all at once
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.31,0:04:21.71,Default,,0,0,0,,—to go to the Samaritans and to the Gentiles.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.71,0:04:23.21,Default,,0,0,0,,They were to focus
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.21,0:04:25.88,Default,,0,0,0,,just on “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.82,0:04:29.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So when we think about this,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.52,0:04:32.69,Default,,0,0,0,,what do we learn from these two verses?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.69,0:04:34.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, first of all,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.69,0:04:38.19,Default,,0,0,0,,yes, the whole world\Nneeded to hear the message.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.19,0:04:42.80,Default,,0,0,0,,But what did Jesus do,\Nand what did he expect of his apostles?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.80,0:04:47.74,Default,,0,0,0,,That they would recognize\Nthat they had a specific assignment.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.74,0:04:49.77,Default,,0,0,0,,They weren’t to be overwhelmed
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.77,0:04:53.61,Default,,0,0,0,,by trying to think of changing\Nthe whole world at that point.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.61,0:04:56.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus showed great trust in Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.58,0:05:01.58,Default,,0,0,0,,He knew that Jehovah\Nwould gradually expand the message
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.58,0:05:04.05,Default,,0,0,0,,and the reach of the message.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.05,0:05:07.69,Default,,0,0,0,,And, of course, we realize\Nthat at Pentecost there was an expansion
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.69,0:05:10.89,Default,,0,0,0,,and then in 36 C.E., another expansion.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.73,0:05:14.23,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what does that mean for you?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.23,0:05:18.87,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, when you return to your assignment\Nor you go to the new one,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.87,0:05:22.64,Default,,0,0,0,,there’s going to be\Nan endless number of possibilities

Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.21,0:05:28.18,Default,,0,0,0,,—to stabilize and strengthen everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.18,0:05:31.45,Default,,0,0,0,,But if you try to take everything on at once,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.45,0:05:33.12,Default,,0,0,0,,you’re going to wear yourself out
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.12,0:05:36.69,Default,,0,0,0,,and probably wear out\Na whole lot of other people as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.69,0:05:41.42,Default,,0,0,0,,You know the English idiom\N“Don’t bite off more than you can chew.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.42,0:05:46.06,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, gradually do the things\Nthat Jehovah has assigned you to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.06,0:05:50.23,Default,,0,0,0,,If you try to be too broad in what you do,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.23,0:05:53.00,Default,,0,0,0,,you may end up not accomplishing much at all
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.00,0:05:55.64,Default,,0,0,0,,except just wearing yourself out.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.64,0:05:58.04,Default,,0,0,0,,But be patient just as Jesus was,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.04,0:06:02.85,Default,,0,0,0,,and recognize that each one of you\Nwill have a specific assignment.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.85,0:06:05.01,Default,,0,0,0,,And then try to work at that,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.01,0:06:07.85,Default,,0,0,0,,trusting that Jehovah will allow

Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.79,0:06:15.79,Default,,0,0,0,,and gradually the effects of your work\Nwill spread to others.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.79,0:06:19.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, an example of this is\Nin the South Pacific,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.48,0:06:39.35,Default,,0,0,0,,And then you find out\Nthere are only ten islands

Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.92,0:06:45.46,Default,,0,0,0,,—ten islands that have\Npublishers and congregations.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.46,0:06:47.46,Default,,0,0,0,,So there are 90 that don’t.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.46,0:06:51.63,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what do you think\Nthe normal enthusiastic response is?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.37,0:07:34.47,Default,,0,0,0,,So normally what happens?
