Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.18,0:00:03.18,Default,,0,0,0,,The matter of dress and grooming
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.19,0:00:05.69,Default,,0,0,0,,is a deeply personal matter.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.69,0:00:07.69,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s something that elicits
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.69,0:00:09.69,Default,,0,0,0,,all sorts of emotions.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.69,0:00:11.69,Default,,0,0,0,,But let me just ask at this point,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.70,0:00:13.70,Default,,0,0,0,,What are you thinking about?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.43,0:00:18.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe you’re thinking,\N‘Why does he have this hat on his head?’
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.67,0:00:20.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Some are thinking,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.67,0:00:25.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‘This must be a very defining moment\Nin Brother Jackson’s lifetime.’
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.68,0:00:28.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Others are thinking:\N‘Is this a new precedent?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.55,0:00:30.55,Default,,0,0,0,,We’ve never done that before.’
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.55,0:00:32.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let me take it off.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.85,0:00:36.22,Default,,0,0,0,,That was an object lesson
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.22,0:00:41.06,Default,,0,0,0,,to point out how distracting\Nour dress and grooming can be.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.06,0:00:44.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, it can distract\Nfrom the message that we bear.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.36,0:00:46.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Instead of thinking about what someone 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.56,0:00:48.60,Default,,0,0,0,,is conveying in the message,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.60,0:00:52.94,Default,,0,0,0,,if our dress and grooming\Nis just out of the ordinary
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.94,0:00:55.08,Default,,0,0,0,,or something that is shocking,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.07,0:00:58.84,Default,,0,0,0,,then it certainly can take away\Nfrom the glory to Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.84,0:01:01.58,Default,,0,0,0,,and also the message that we bear.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.58,0:01:03.58,Default,,0,0,0,,But when we go around the world,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.58,0:01:07.42,Default,,0,0,0,,we see a large variety of dress and grooming
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.42,0:01:09.62,Default,,0,0,0,,used by our brothers and sisters.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.62,0:01:11.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Without showing you photos,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.79,0:01:14.89,Default,,0,0,0,,you might remember\Nmany of the Watchtower{\i1}{\fs18}{\fnSerif} {\r}photographs
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.89,0:01:16.89,Default,,0,0,0,,where our brothers are witnessing.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.89,0:01:20.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Some don’t have a tie;\Nothers don’t have a jacket.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.80,0:01:22.80,Default,,0,0,0,,In Fiji, of course,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.80,0:01:25.57,Default,,0,0,0,,men wear what might be referred to
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.57,0:01:27.61,Default,,0,0,0,,as a kilt, or a sulu. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.60,0:01:32.37,Default,,0,0,0,,So there’s a large variety of dresses
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.38,0:01:35.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and costumes and outfits that are acceptable.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.65,0:01:38.75,Default,,0,0,0,,And we probably noticed, too,\Nsome of the Governing Body members,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.75,0:01:41.82,Default,,0,0,0,,when they’ve released Bibles\Nor have been at conventions,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.82,0:01:45.89,Default,,0,0,0,,they have donned some of the local attire.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.89,0:01:48.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So it’s not as if Jehovah’s organization
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.96,0:01:51.33,Default,,0,0,0,,is so strict and inflexible
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.33,0:01:55.64,Default,,0,0,0,,that we all have to dress\Nexactly the same way.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.63,0:01:58.57,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s true, there are various circumstances
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.57,0:02:00.61,Default,,0,0,0,,that God’s people face.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.60,0:02:04.74,Default,,0,0,0,,In some countries,\Nthere’s such a variety of items
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.74,0:02:07.14,Default,,0,0,0,,that we can use for dress and grooming.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.14,0:02:09.94,Default,,0,0,0,,In other countries,\Nthere really aren’t as many things
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.95,0:02:11.95,Default,,0,0,0,,that our brothers can use.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.95,0:02:13.95,Default,,0,0,0,,I know my wife and I were very touched
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.95,0:02:17.59,Default,,0,0,0,,a number of years ago\Nwhen we attended a regional convention.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.59,0:02:20.76,Default,,0,0,0,,As I was waiting to give the last talk,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.76,0:02:22.93,Default,,0,0,0,,sitting behind the platform,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.93,0:02:25.13,Default,,0,0,0,,I noticed the brothers and sisters
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.13,0:02:27.77,Default,,0,0,0,,who were in the Watchtower Study\Nwere giving comments.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.76,0:02:29.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And it really touched my heart
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.77,0:02:33.17,Default,,0,0,0,,when I saw sisters come off of the platform
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.17,0:02:35.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and then give their shoes and their jewelry
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.81,0:02:39.38,Default,,0,0,0,,to other sisters who were\Nabout to go on the same platform.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.38,0:02:43.08,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, they didn’t have much;\Nthey shared what they had.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.08,0:02:45.55,Default,,0,0,0,,They didn’t have a lot of choice.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.55,0:02:50.19,Default,,0,0,0,,But sometimes we know\Nthat some of you dear sisters, particularly,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.19,0:02:52.23,Default,,0,0,0,,may go into a department store
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.22,0:02:55.12,Default,,0,0,0,,and it may look like you have a huge variety
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.12,0:02:57.16,Default,,0,0,0,,of things that you can choose from.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.16,0:03:00.13,Default,,0,0,0,,But when you start looking,\Nsometimes you may feel
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.13,0:03:02.53,Default,,0,0,0,,like those sisters\Nat that particular convention
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.53,0:03:07.13,Default,,0,0,0,,—that there really isn’t a lot\Nthat you can use as a Christian.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.14,0:03:09.14,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what can help us?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.14,0:03:11.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the encouraging thing is\Nthat wherever you go in the world
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.61,0:03:15.45,Default,,0,0,0,,where the brothers have ties or jackets\Nor whatever they have,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.45,0:03:17.45,Default,,0,0,0,,there’s one thing in common:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.45,0:03:22.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah’s people try to be neat,\Nclean, and presentable.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.45,0:03:25.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And from the Governing Body’s viewpoint,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.12,0:03:28.72,Default,,0,0,0,,of course, you know\Nwe’re not trying to make all sorts of rules
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.73,0:03:30.80,Default,,0,0,0,,—rigid rules—\Nwith regard to this.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.79,0:03:35.16,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what can help us to help our brothers\Nand sisters to have the right viewpoint
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.16,0:03:37.93,Default,,0,0,0,,—the viewpoint that brings glory to Jehovah?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.93,0:03:41.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I thought\Nwe might think of five Scriptural principles.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.20,0:03:44.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, there are many other\NScriptural principles we could look at,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.81,0:03:47.75,Default,,0,0,0,,but these are five principles\Nthat perhaps could help us.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.74,0:03:50.01,Default,,0,0,0,,So, first of all, let’s take our Bibles
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.01,0:03:54.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and turn to 1 Timothy 2:9,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.52,0:03:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and we are going to have this on the screen
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.52,0:03:58.72,Default,,0,0,0,,with the highlighted portions.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.72,0:04:02.62,Default,,0,0,0,,“Likewise, the women\Nshould adorn themselves
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.63,0:04:07.64,Default,,0,0,0,,“in appropriate [and then notice\Nthe footnote says “respectable”] dress,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.63,0:04:11.40,Default,,0,0,0,,“with modesty and soundness of mind
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.40,0:04:15.70,Default,,0,0,0,,“[and again look at the footnote,\N“good judgment; sensibleness”],
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.74,0:04:19.78,Default,,0,0,0,,“not with styles of hair braiding and gold
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.78,0:04:23.12,Default,,0,0,0,,or pearls or very expensive clothing.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.45,0:04:26.49,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what principle do we get here,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.48,0:04:28.85,Default,,0,0,0,,no matter where we live in the world?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.85,0:04:32.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, certainly,\Nwe wouldn’t want any clothing
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.02,0:04:35.19,Default,,0,0,0,,that’s showy or bizarre
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.19,0:04:38.76,Default,,0,0,0,,or provocative or that’s revealing
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.76,0:04:42.43,Default,,0,0,0,,or too extreme with regard to fads.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.43,0:04:45.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Again, the principle of the hat
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.44,0:04:49.14,Default,,0,0,0,,—if we’re doing something\Nor wearing something that,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.14,0:04:53.88,Default,,0,0,0,,really, is so different\Nfrom what is expected, what happens?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.88,0:04:58.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, perhaps at the very least,\Nit distracts from the message,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.55,0:05:00.72,Default,,0,0,0,,but it could be\Na lot worse than that, couldn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.72,0:05:05.73,Default,,0,0,0,,It could give the wrong impression\Nwith regard to our morals and so forth.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.72,0:05:08.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, a second scripture we can look at
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.36,0:05:12.53,Default,,0,0,0,,is at 2 Corinthians 6:3.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.53,0:05:17.90,Default,,0,0,0,,“In no way are we giving\Nany cause for stumbling,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.90,0:05:21.57,Default,,0,0,0,,so that no fault\Nmay be found with our ministry.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.57,0:05:23.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice the comment here,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.81,0:05:27.01,Default,,0,0,0,,“no way” or “any cause.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.64,0:05:32.11,Default,,0,0,0,,So whatever selections we make\Nwith regard to dress and grooming,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.12,0:05:34.16,Default,,0,0,0,,we certainly would want to make sure
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.15,0:05:38.35,Default,,0,0,0,,that in no way at all\Ncould this cause some stumbling
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.35,0:05:40.35,Default,,0,0,0,,on the part of those
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.36,0:05:44.30,Default,,0,0,0,,not only outside the congregation\Nwhen we’re presenting the message
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.29,0:05:46.56,Default,,0,0,0,,but also within the congregation.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.56,0:05:50.40,Default,,0,0,0,,If we were to wear something\Nthat could be provocative,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.40,0:05:54.77,Default,,0,0,0,,perhaps it would arouse\Nin some wrong desires.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.77,0:05:57.97,Default,,0,0,0,,So having that in mind\Ngives us a good principle
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.97,0:06:01.61,Default,,0,0,0,,with regard to selection\Nof dress and grooming.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.61,0:06:03.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, a third principle
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.71,0:06:07.45,Default,,0,0,0,,is found in the book of Numbers 15:39.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.02,0:06:11.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And we might say\Nthat this is in the context
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.35,0:06:14.89,Default,,0,0,0,,of the Israelite nation\Nwhen Jehovah did give them
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.89,0:06:19.29,Default,,0,0,0,,some strict laws\Nwith regard to dress and grooming
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.30,0:06:21.60,Default,,0,0,0,,—laws that made sure the Israelites
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.60,0:06:24.04,Default,,0,0,0,,would be different\Nfrom the nations around them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.03,0:06:26.77,Default,,0,0,0,,So let’s read Numbers 15:39:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.77,0:06:30.61,Default,,0,0,0,,“You must have this fringed edge\Nso that you will see it
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.61,0:06:34.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and remember all the commandments\Nof Jehovah and observe them.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.64,0:06:36.64,Default,,0,0,0,,And notice this point:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.65,0:06:40.52,Default,,0,0,0,,“You must not follow\Nyour own hearts and eyes,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.52,0:06:44.39,Default,,0,0,0,,which are leading you\Nto spiritual prostitution.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.39,0:06:46.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, that’s a very interesting principle,\Nisn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.22,0:06:49.42,Default,,0,0,0,,We’re not for one minute suggesting
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.43,0:06:53.40,Default,,0,0,0,,that we have to have these fringed edges\Non our garments today.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.40,0:06:55.44,Default,,0,0,0,,But what’s the thought?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.43,0:06:57.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah was telling them
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.50,0:06:59.64,Default,,0,0,0,,that when you’re selecting what you wear,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.64,0:07:03.24,Default,,0,0,0,,don’t just follow your hearts and eyes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.24,0:07:06.51,Default,,0,0,0,,In other words, we shouldn’t feel:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.51,0:07:09.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‘Well, I really like this.\NThis is just nice.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.75,0:07:11.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‘It suits me.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.81,0:07:14.21,Default,,0,0,0,,It reflects the colors of my skin,’
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.22,0:07:17.26,Default,,0,0,0,,or whatever other feelings we may have.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.25,0:07:21.69,Default,,0,0,0,,But, rather, there are a lot more factors\Nto take into consideration.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.69,0:07:24.56,Default,,0,0,0,,No doubt,\Nthere were some back in Israelite times
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.56,0:07:27.73,Default,,0,0,0,,that didn’t like a fringe\Non the edge of their garments,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.73,0:07:30.57,Default,,0,0,0,,but having in mind what Jehovah wanted
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.57,0:07:33.11,Default,,0,0,0,,helped them to see what they needed to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.10,0:07:36.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So the principle\Nis a good principle for us today
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.01,0:07:38.41,Default,,0,0,0,,—to ask such questions as:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.41,0:07:41.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Will this raise eyebrows?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.11,0:07:45.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Will it lower the standards that I have?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.21,0:07:47.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Does it fit?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.78,0:07:52.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Is it the appropriate dress for my age?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.46,0:07:56.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Those are important questions\Nthat all of us need to think about.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.89,0:07:58.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, a fourth principle is found
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.90,0:08:03.54,Default,,0,0,0,,at 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.17,0:08:06.77,Default,,0,0,0,,And again, it’s one of the principles
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.77,0:08:10.44,Default,,0,0,0,,perhaps we would have thought\Nof when we were thinking about this subject.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.44,0:08:12.81,Default,,0,0,0,,“All things are lawful,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.81,0:08:16.01,Default,,0,0,0,,“but not all things are advantageous.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.01,0:08:18.01,Default,,0,0,0,,“All things are lawful,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.01,0:08:20.65,Default,,0,0,0,,“but not all things build up.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.65,0:08:24.45,Default,,0,0,0,,“Let each one keep seeking,\Nnot his own advantage,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.45,0:08:26.82,Default,,0,0,0,,but that of the other person.”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.82,0:08:30.82,Default,,0,0,0,,So again, what type of questions\Nwould we need to ask?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.83,0:08:34.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, perhaps this selection we’ve made
