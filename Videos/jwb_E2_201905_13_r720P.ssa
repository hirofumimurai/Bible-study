Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.05,0:00:04.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Today’s scripture text and Watchtower comments
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.25,0:00:07.29,Default,,0,0,0,,encourage us to exert ourselves
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.29,0:00:09.49,Default,,0,0,0,,to show love to others,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.49,0:00:11.69,Default,,0,0,0,,especially our brothers.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.70,0:00:14.07,Default,,0,0,0,,So let’s discuss the theme
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.06,0:00:17.53,Default,,0,0,0,,“Pursue the Way of Love.”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.53,0:00:19.87,Default,,0,0,0,,And interestingly, that expression,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.87,0:00:23.34,Default,,0,0,0,,“pursue love,” is found three times in the Bible.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.34,0:00:27.28,Default,,0,0,0,,The verb “pursue” is very appropriate.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.28,0:00:28.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.48,0:00:30.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it means to chase,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.55,0:00:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,to persistently follow in an effort
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.82,0:00:35.19,Default,,0,0,0,,to overtake or capture.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.19,0:00:37.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we could illustrate with
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.42,0:00:40.99,Default,,0,0,0,,a small child chasing a butterfly
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.99,0:00:43.49,Default,,0,0,0,,—pursuing it, chasing,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.49,0:00:48.10,Default,,0,0,0,,pursuing in an effort to overtake or capture.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.10,0:00:50.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what is the butterfly trying to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.80,0:00:54.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Get away, escape, evade.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.50,0:00:58.47,Default,,0,0,0,,If we think about it, that’s what love tries to do to us.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.48,0:00:59.81,Default,,0,0,0,,But, now, why?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.81,0:01:04.25,Default,,0,0,0,,The question is,\NWhy does love try to get away from us,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.25,0:01:06.95,Default,,0,0,0,,thus requiring that we pursue it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.95,0:01:08.95,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the main reason
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.95,0:01:12.45,Default,,0,0,0,,is because of the imperfection that we’ve inherited.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.46,0:01:15.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Genesis 1:27 tells us
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.46,0:01:18.56,Default,,0,0,0,,that originally Adam was made
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.56,0:01:20.60,Default,,0,0,0,,in Jehovah’s image,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.60,0:01:23.70,Default,,0,0,0,,perfectly reflecting Jehovah and his qualities.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.70,0:01:25.90,Default,,0,0,0,,He did that just perfectly.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.90,0:01:28.30,Default,,0,0,0,,But then when he sinned,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.30,0:01:30.50,Default,,0,0,0,,imperfection entered.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.51,0:01:33.05,Default,,0,0,0,,And we could say that Adam became
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.04,0:01:36.68,Default,,0,0,0,,a distorted reflection of Jehovah and his qualities.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.68,0:01:37.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we can illustrate this
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.68,0:01:41.62,Default,,0,0,0,,with a distorted mirror,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.62,0:01:45.12,Default,,0,0,0,,perhaps at the fair or circus.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.12,0:01:48.42,Default,,0,0,0,,It can make you look a lot taller,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.42,0:01:50.72,Default,,0,0,0,,a lot shorter, a lot fatter,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.73,0:01:52.77,Default,,0,0,0,,a lot thinner than you really are
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.76,0:01:54.80,Default,,0,0,0,,and distort you in other ways.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.80,0:01:58.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, in effect, Adam became a distorted reflection
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.54,0:02:01.28,Default,,0,0,0,,of Jehovah and his qualities,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.27,0:02:03.37,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’ve inherited that condition.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.37,0:02:06.01,Default,,0,0,0,,We are distorted reflections
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.01,0:02:08.58,Default,,0,0,0,,of Jehovah and his qualities,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.58,0:02:11.25,Default,,0,0,0,,so we have to pursue love.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.25,0:02:13.42,Default,,0,0,0,,But now let me ask this,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.42,0:02:16.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Would you say\Nthat Jehovah is pursuing the way of love?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.12,0:02:20.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that could be a trick question.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.42,0:02:24.76,Default,,0,0,0,,But is Jehovah chasing, trying to catch love?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.50,0:02:26.67,Default,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.66,0:02:30.30,Default,,0,0,0,,First John 4:8: “God is love.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.30,0:02:32.77,Default,,0,0,0,,He just naturally displays it, see.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.77,0:02:34.77,Default,,0,0,0,,He doesn’t have to work at it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.77,0:02:37.87,Default,,0,0,0,,He, you can say, radiates it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.87,0:02:40.04,Default,,0,0,0,,It emanates from Jehovah God.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.04,0:02:42.04,Default,,0,0,0,,But with us it’s different, see.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.05,0:02:44.05,Default,,0,0,0,,In our imperfection,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.05,0:02:46.82,Default,,0,0,0,,love is not our natural inclination;
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.82,0:02:48.86,Default,,0,0,0,,we have to pursue it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.85,0:02:51.05,Default,,0,0,0,,But now the question is, How do we do it?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.05,0:02:55.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the entire Bible tells us how to pursue love,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.49,0:02:59.53,Default,,0,0,0,,but specifically the five verses
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.53,0:03:02.30,Default,,0,0,0,,at 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.30,0:03:05.60,Default,,0,0,0,,tell us how to pursue love.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.60,0:03:08.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, there we have 16 expressions of love:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.50,0:03:12.47,Default,,0,0,0,,nine ways that love does not behave
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.48,0:03:15.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and seven ways that it does behave.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.91,0:03:20.18,Default,,0,0,0,,And if we closely examine\Nthose 16 expressions of love,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.18,0:03:24.68,Default,,0,0,0,,we’ll have direction in our pursuit of love.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.69,0:03:26.96,Default,,0,0,0,,We won’t wander aimlessly;
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.96,0:03:29.63,Default,,0,0,0,,we won’t travel erroneously.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.63,0:03:31.63,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, as time permits,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.63,0:03:33.87,Default,,0,0,0,,let’s discuss some of the ways that love
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.86,0:03:37.46,Default,,0,0,0,,does not act and ways it doesn’t behave.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.47,0:03:40.77,Default,,0,0,0,,One: “Love is not jealous.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.87,0:03:46.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, in the Bible, jealousy can have\Na good connotation or a bad connotation.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.51,0:03:51.12,Default,,0,0,0,,In the good connotation,\Nit’s closely related to zealous.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.11,0:03:54.18,Default,,0,0,0,,But, of course,\Nhere Jehovah is using it in the bad sense,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.18,0:03:58.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and by far the majority of times\Nin the Bible that’s the way the word is  used.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.92,0:04:00.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what does it mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.42,0:04:02.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it means envious
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.79,0:04:06.23,Default,,0,0,0,,of good things coming to others.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.23,0:04:08.63,Default,,0,0,0,,It can be worse than anger.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.63,0:04:12.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Anger can come and pass quickly,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.97,0:04:16.41,Default,,0,0,0,,but jealousy can be harbored deep.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.41,0:04:18.65,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, Proverbs 14:30
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.64,0:04:23.05,Default,,0,0,0,,talks about it being deep down in the bones.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.05,0:04:26.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, how can we avoid jealousy
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.48,0:04:30.58,Default,,0,0,0,,and pursue love even though it’s not easy?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.59,0:04:33.89,Default,,0,0,0,,We have to prayerfully, with Jehovah’s help,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.89,0:04:36.89,Default,,0,0,0,,do what is mentioned in Romans chapter 12.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.89,0:04:38.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Please turn there.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.23,0:04:40.27,Default,,0,0,0,,In Romans chapter 12,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.26,0:04:42.83,Default,,0,0,0,,here’s what Jehovah tells us to do,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.83,0:04:44.87,Default,,0,0,0,,verse number 15:
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.90,0:04:49.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“Rejoice with those who rejoice;
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.51,0:04:52.88,Default,,0,0,0,,weep with those who weep.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.88,0:04:54.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Now think about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.24,0:04:56.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Which of the two is the hardest?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.45,0:04:59.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, generally, it’s not so hard\Nto weep with someone who is weeping.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.92,0:05:03.22,Default,,0,0,0,,They found out they have cancer;\Nthey lose a loved one in death.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.22,0:05:05.66,Default,,0,0,0,,We can be very sorry with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.66,0:05:07.83,Default,,0,0,0,,But, now, often it’s harder
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.82,0:05:11.32,Default,,0,0,0,,to rejoice with someone who rejoices.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.33,0:05:13.33,Default,,0,0,0,,They may receive some good thing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.33,0:05:15.67,Default,,0,0,0,,or something good has happened to them,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.67,0:05:17.17,Default,,0,0,0,,and it didn’t happen to us.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.17,0:05:19.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, here’s just one little illustration:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.44,0:05:22.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s say an elder is so happy that he received
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.94,0:05:26.08,Default,,0,0,0,,an assignment for the regional convention.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.08,0:05:28.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we’ve always wanted to get an assignment,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.38,0:05:30.25,Default,,0,0,0,,but we didn’t get an assignment.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.25,0:05:32.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Are we going to rejoice
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.48,0:05:34.98,Default,,0,0,0,,with our brother who is rejoicing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.98,0:05:36.98,Default,,0,0,0,,—not just on the outside,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.99,0:05:39.23,Default,,0,0,0,,outwardly appearing that we’re happy for him—
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.22,0:05:41.22,Default,,0,0,0,,but inside we have jealousy?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.22,0:05:44.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Truly in our heart being happy,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.03,0:05:47.37,Default,,0,0,0,,rejoicing with our brother who is rejoicing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.36,0:05:49.53,Default,,0,0,0,,—with Jehovah’s help—\Nwe can do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.53,0:05:51.80,Default,,0,0,0,,We can work on our attitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.80,0:05:54.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you think about it, about the only emotion
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.80,0:05:59.04,Default,,0,0,0,,that is stronger than jealousy is love.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.04,0:06:03.24,Default,,0,0,0,,With love we can smash jealousy.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.25,0:06:06.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, another expression of love:\NLove “does not brag.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.42,0:06:09.82,Default,,0,0,0,,If we’re pursuing the way of love,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.82,0:06:12.39,Default,,0,0,0,,we will prayerfully work hard
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.39,0:06:15.43,Default,,0,0,0,,not to elevate ourselves in our speech.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.43,0:06:19.83,Default,,0,0,0,,We’ll strive not to so often use the pronouns
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.83,0:06:22.20,Default,,0,0,0,,“I” and “me,”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.20,0:06:24.64,Default,,0,0,0,,thus directing attention to ourselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.63,0:06:26.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Rather, we’ll play our role down.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.97,0:06:29.31,Default,,0,0,0,,We’ll direct attention to others
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.31,0:06:32.41,Default,,0,0,0,,and especially to our God, Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.41,0:06:34.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Another expression of love:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.58,0:06:37.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Love “does not get puffed up.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.91,0:06:40.91,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, puffed up is closely related to bragging
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.92,0:06:44.02,Default,,0,0,0,,because normally a person\Nwho is puffed up brags, doesn’t he?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.02,0:06:48.39,Default,,0,0,0,,But do you think it would be possible\Nto be puffed up and not brag?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.39,0:06:49.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.56,0:06:53.66,Default,,0,0,0,,We could actually have this attitude, \Nthinking too much of ourselves
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.66,0:06:57.33,Default,,0,0,0,,even though we didn’t make\Nan outward expression of that attitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.33,0:06:59.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, why would that be unloving
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.37,0:07:02.74,Default,,0,0,0,,if we were puffed up but we didn’t brag?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.74,0:07:06.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, others would sense it
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.01,0:07:08.38,Default,,0,0,0,,—see, that attitude would come across.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.38,0:07:10.82,Default,,0,0,0,,It would project and, in effect,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.81,0:07:13.98,Default,,0,0,0,,it would put others down rather than build them up.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.98,0:07:18.18,Default,,0,0,0,,And most important,\NJehovah would read that attitude in our heart,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.19,0:07:20.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and he wouldn’t bless us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.22,0:07:23.22,Default,,0,0,0,,So here’s what he\Ntells us to do regarding our thinking.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.23,0:07:25.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Romans 12 again,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.39,0:07:28.39,Default,,0,0,0,,and this time take a look at verse 3,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.40,0:07:32.17,Default,,0,0,0,,and right in the middle there Jehovah says:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.17,0:07:34.84,Default,,0,0,0,,“I tell everyone there among you
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.84,0:07:38.88,Default,,0,0,0,,“not to think more of himself
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.88,0:07:41.35,Default,,0,0,0,,than it is necessary to think.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.34,0:07:43.41,Default,,0,0,0,,So you notice, Jehovah is saying that we
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.41,0:07:45.88,Default,,0,0,0,,shouldn’t even think that way about ourselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.88,0:07:49.38,Default,,0,0,0,,We should have a humble attitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.39,0:07:51.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Another expression of love:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.65,0:07:55.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Love “does not behave indecently.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.39,0:07:58.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, there are varying degrees of indecency
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.36,0:08:01.60,Default,,0,0,0,,—shocking indecency, immorality.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.60,0:08:03.64,Default,,0,0,0,,But on the other end of the spectrum,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.63,0:08:06.53,Default,,0,0,0,,perhaps a lack of good manners.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.54,0:08:09.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we don’t even\Nwant to be slightly indecent, do we?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.61,0:08:13.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Especially as Bethelites,\Nwe want to have good manners
