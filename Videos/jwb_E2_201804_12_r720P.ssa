Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.28,0:06:34.58,Default,,0,0,0,,for substituting “LORD” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.58,0:06:38.48,Default,,0,0,0,,is because “Jehovah” \Nis not the original pronunciation \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.48,0:06:41.35,Default,,0,0,0,,or that it should be “Yahweh.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.35,0:06:45.15,Default,,0,0,0,,But the fact is we don’t pronounce \NAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob \N

Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.33,0:06:57.33,Default,,0,0,0,,But following their reasoning, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.33,0:07:00.77,Default,,0,0,0,,their translation should say: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.55,0:07:16.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, this is obviously \Nan unreasonable approach \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.72,0:07:20.19,Default,,0,0,0,,to translating the first three names, \Ndon’t you agree? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.19,0:07:23.69,Default,,0,0,0,,But that’s exactly what they did \Nwith the fourth name. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.69,0:07:26.00,Default,,0,0,0,,They said, \N‘We don’t pronounce it the same way, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.71,0:07:40.24,Default,,0,0,0,,what about the name Jesus? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.24,0:07:42.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Acts 4:12 says: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.56,0:08:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,which would affect the pronunciation. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.00,0:08:02.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Hebrew would be something like Ye·shuʹa‛; \N
