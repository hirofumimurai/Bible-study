Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.64,0:01:32.64,Default,,0,0,0,,who were “acting as a restraint,”
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.64,0:01:35.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and imitation Christians

Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.95,0:02:52.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, here’s the first similarity:

Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.94,0:03:14.38,Default,,0,0,0,,And then it says that that anointed group

Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.45,0:03:20.49,Default,,0,0,0,,But then it asks, What is the land, though?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.48,0:03:22.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Here’s the answer:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.25,0:03:27.05,Default,,0,0,0,,It is the realm of activity\Ngranted to the newborn nation,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.06,0:03:30.20,Default,,0,0,0,,a place where Bible prophecies
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.19,0:03:33.16,Default,,0,0,0,,have a modern, spiritual fulfillment.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.16,0:03:34.46,Default,,0,0,0,,So did you get that?

Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.80,0:03:40.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Now here’s a second similarity:

Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.88,0:03:50.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we certainly know\Nthat was true of the garden of Eden
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.48,0:03:54.32,Default,,0,0,0,,where Adam and Eve were,\Nbut what about in our spiritual paradise?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.32,0:03:56.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Who are the plants and trees?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.79,0:04:00.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the Bible likens God’s people
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.32,0:04:02.32,Default,,0,0,0,,to plants and trees.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.33,0:04:04.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Here’s what 1 Corinthians 3:9 says:

Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.65,0:04:27.82,Default,,0,0,0,,And just like those plants\Nand trees in the garden of Eden,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.94,0:04:54.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah foretold it would exist
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.94,0:04:59.55,Default,,0,0,0,,and, as a contrast,\Nhe said at Isaiah 65:13:

Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.69,0:06:12.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Here’s a fourth similarity:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.42,0:06:17.22,Default,,0,0,0,,The Bible tells us\Nthat out of the garden of Eden a river flowed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.23,0:06:19.47,Default,,0,0,0,,So it must have been a large river,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.46,0:06:22.10,Default,,0,0,0,,and it divided into four other rivers.
