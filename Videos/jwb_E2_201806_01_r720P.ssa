Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.34,0:03:09.77,Default,,0,0,0,,But no, this is a woodpile,

Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.40,0:03:43.51,Default,,0,0,0,,from this “Witness Pile” called Gilead.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.51,0:03:48.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s go to the origin, \Nback in Genesis chapter 31
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.18,0:03:52.35,Default,,0,0,0,,—Genesis chapter 31.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.78,0:03:55.95,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, a little context:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.95,0:03:58.62,Default,,0,0,0,,The patriarch Jacob
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.62,0:04:03.13,Default,,0,0,0,,was tired of being cheated \Nby his father-in-law, Laban.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.13,0:04:05.13,Default,,0,0,0,,And as we read the Scriptures,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.13,0:04:08.06,Default,,0,0,0,,we know that Laban \Nwas kind of a shady character;
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.06,0:04:10.90,Default,,0,0,0,,you wouldn’t want to buy \Na used car from Laban.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.17,0:04:14.97,Default,,0,0,0,,And so Jacob got tired of being cheated,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.97,0:04:19.18,Default,,0,0,0,,and so he ran away \Nwith his wives and his children.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.18,0:04:21.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Laban ran after him.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.48,0:04:23.75,Default,,0,0,0,,And when he caught up with Jacob,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.75,0:04:28.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Laban and Jacob \Nmade a covenant of peace.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.45,0:04:32.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we’ll take up \Nthe reading from verse 43.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.26,0:04:37.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So this is Genesis 31, \Nbeginning with verse 43:
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.26,0:04:40.53,Default,,0,0,0,,“Then Laban answered Jacob:
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.53,0:04:42.60,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘The daughters are my daughters
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.60,0:04:44.67,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘and the children my children

Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.74,0:04:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,and everything you are looking at is mine.’”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.57,0:04:52.98,Default,,0,0,0,,It tells you what kind \Nof a person he was, doesn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.98,0:04:54.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Verse 44:
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.74,0:04:58.41,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Now come, \Nlet us make a covenant, you and I,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.41,0:05:03.42,Default,,0,0,0,,“and it will serve \Nas a witness between us.’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.35,0:05:08.36,Default,,0,0,0,,“So Jacob took a stone \Nand set it up as a pillar.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.36,0:05:10.56,Default,,0,0,0,,“Then Jacob said to his brothers:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.56,0:05:12.56,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Pick up stones!’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.56,0:05:16.70,Default,,0,0,0,,And they took stones and made a pile.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.70,0:05:18.37,Default,,0,0,0,,And notice this:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.37,0:05:21.04,Default,,0,0,0,,“After that they ate there
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.04,0:05:24.24,Default,,0,0,0,,on the pile of stones.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.24,0:05:28.51,Default,,0,0,0,,So scholars tell us \Nthat this “pile of stones”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.51,0:05:31.68,Default,,0,0,0,,must have been quite neatly arranged,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.68,0:05:35.49,Default,,0,0,0,,so that it would form a kind of a table,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.49,0:05:39.69,Default,,0,0,0,,and they had \Ntheir meal of peace on this table.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.69,0:05:42.39,Default,,0,0,0,,And, of course, \Nthis was to serve as a monument.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.39,0:05:45.93,Default,,0,0,0,,It was to be a monument \Nof the covenant of peace
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.93,0:05:48.50,Default,,0,0,0,,between Laban and Jacob.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.50,0:05:52.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, let’s carry on, verse 47:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.30,0:05:57.31,Default,,0,0,0,,“And Laban began calling it Jegar-sahadutha,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.31,0:06:00.31,Default,,0,0,0,,but Jacob called it Galeed.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.61,0:06:04.48,Default,,0,0,0,,When the brothers \Nwere picking a name for the school,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.48,0:06:06.98,Default,,0,0,0,,aren’t you glad \Nthey didn’t go with Laban’s?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.58,0:06:10.99,Default,,0,0,0,,How would you students like to be graduates
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.99,0:06:15.32,Default,,0,0,0,,of the Watchtower Bible School \Nof Jegar-sahadutha?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.32,0:06:17.66,Default,,0,0,0,,That would be a mouthful, wouldn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.66,0:06:21.93,Default,,0,0,0,,So they chose Galeed, or Gilead.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.93,0:06:23.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Verses 48 and 49:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.93,0:06:25.77,Default,,0,0,0,,“Laban then said:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.77,0:06:29.51,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘This pile of stones is a witness
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.51,0:06:32.01,Default,,0,0,0,,“between me and you today.’
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.01,0:06:37.01,Default,,0,0,0,,That is why he named it Galeed, \Nand the Watchtower.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.01,0:06:40.95,Default,,0,0,0,,And isn’t it interesting \Nthat both “Watchtower” and “Gilead”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.95,0:06:43.62,Default,,0,0,0,,are in the name of our school?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.62,0:06:47.39,Default,,0,0,0,,But what was the purpose \Nof the pile of rocks?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.39,0:06:49.63,Default,,0,0,0,,Verse 52:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.63,0:06:53.90,Default,,0,0,0,,“This pile of stones is a witness,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.90,0:06:56.93,Default,,0,0,0,,“and the pillar is something \Nthat bears witness,

Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.67,0:07:01.67,Default,,0,0,0,,“to bring harm to you
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.67,0:07:06.68,Default,,0,0,0,,“and you will not pass \Nbeyond this pile of stones and this pillar
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.68,0:07:09.68,Default,,0,0,0,,to bring harm to me.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.68,0:07:12.05,Default,,0,0,0,,So this Gilead,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.05,0:07:14.68,Default,,0,0,0,,this “pile of stones,”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.68,0:07:17.69,Default,,0,0,0,,this “Witness Pile,”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.69,0:07:20.12,Default,,0,0,0,,was really a monument.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.12,0:07:24.79,Default,,0,0,0,,It was a symbol of peace and unity.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.79,0:07:27.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And anytime someone \Nwould pass by that monument,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.80,0:07:31.23,Default,,0,0,0,,that “pile of stones,” \Nthat “witness heap,” if you like,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.60,0:07:36.74,Default,,0,0,0,,they would be reminded of the need for unity.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.74,0:07:41.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, the unity between Laban and Jacob
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.01,0:07:43.28,Default,,0,0,0,,didn’t come about automatically.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.28,0:07:44.95,Default,,0,0,0,,We read verse 43.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.95,0:07:48.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Did you notice \Nthe accusations that Laban made

Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.96,0:08:05.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, them were fighting words.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.30,0:08:08.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Jacob had worked very hard \Nfor everything he got.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.48,0:08:18.95,Default,,0,0,0,,So Laban had no right \Nto say that it was all his,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.95,0:08:21.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and Jacob could have taken exception to it;
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.15,0:08:22.82,Default,,0,0,0,,but he bit his tongue.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.82,0:08:24.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.05,0:08:26.06,Default,,0,0,0,,The goal was peace.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.89,0:08:32.36,Default,,0,0,0,,So Jacob took the high road.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.96,0:13:35.00,Default,,0,0,0,,to avoid being “weighed down with overeating

Dialogue: 0,0:14:36.09,0:14:41.06,Default,,0,0,0,,A lot of us need to focus on supplicating

Dialogue: 0,0:15:48.73,0:15:53.00,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s very basic, \Nbut look at Matthew chapter 6
