Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.12,0:00:06.99,Default,,0,0,0,,the apostle Paul was a very humble man. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.99,0:00:09.09,Default,,0,0,0,,He was flexible. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.09,0:00:12.70,Default,,0,0,0,,He says: “To the Jews I became as a Jew,” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.70,0:00:17.30,Default,,0,0,0,,and “to those under law \NI became as under law.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.30,0:00:20.54,Default,,0,0,0,,But there were limits to Paul’s flexibility, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.54,0:00:23.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’re going to talk \Nabout that in just a few moments.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.81,0:00:27.48,Default,,0,0,0,,First of all, though, \Nwhen Paul came down to Jerusalem,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.48,0:00:32.12,Default,,0,0,0,,the elders explained that thousands of Jews \Nhad become believers \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.12,0:00:35.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and they were all zealous for the Law. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.95,0:00:39.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, they’d heard a rumor about Paul. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.46,0:00:42.56,Default,,0,0,0,,They’d heard the rumor \Nthat Paul was telling the Jews \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.56,0:00:45.43,Default,,0,0,0,,not to circumcise their children, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.43,0:00:47.86,Default,,0,0,0,,and the elders were worried about it. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.86,0:00:49.83,Default,,0,0,0,,They had a plan. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.83,0:00:53.10,Default,,0,0,0,,We read about that plan in Acts chapter 21, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.10,0:00:56.31,Default,,0,0,0,,if you would like to turn there, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.31,0:01:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Acts 21:23, 24. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.45,0:01:09.95,Default,,0,0,0,,Here’s their plan: \N“So do what we tell you:\N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.53,0:01:17.79,Default,,0,0,0,,“Take these men with you \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.79,0:01:21.60,Default,,0,0,0,,“and cleanse yourself ceremonially \Ntogether with them \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.60,0:01:23.67,Default,,0,0,0,,“and take care of their expenses, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.67,0:01:26.37,Default,,0,0,0,,“so that they may have \Ntheir heads shaved. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.37,0:01:29.64,Default,,0,0,0,,“Then everyone will know \Nthat there is nothing \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.91,0:01:35.48,Default,,0,0,0,,“but that you are walking orderly \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.48,0:01:40.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and you are also keeping the Law.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.05,0:01:46.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, it says they have heard \Na rumor about you,\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.12,0:01:48.99,Default,,0,0,0,,that you were telling Jews \Nnot to circumcise their children. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.99,0:01:52.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Paul was probably not telling Jews \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.00,0:01:55.00,Default,,0,0,0,,not to circumcise their children. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.00,0:01:57.20,Default,,0,0,0,,As has already been mentioned, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.20,0:02:00.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Paul took Timothy and circumcised him \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.34,0:02:02.74,Default,,0,0,0,,so as not to stumble the Jews. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.74,0:02:06.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Paul realized that there was nothing wrong \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.14,0:02:08.28,Default,,0,0,0,,with circumcision per se. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.28,0:02:11.68,Default,,0,0,0,,It was when people \Nproclaimed that circumcision \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.68,0:02:15.75,Default,,0,0,0,,was necessary in order to gain salvation \Nthat the problem arose. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.75,0:02:17.75,Default,,0,0,0,,So this was a rumor. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.75,0:02:21.42,Default,,0,0,0,,But some brothers and sisters \Nwere willing to believe a rumor \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.42,0:02:25.90,Default,,0,0,0,,about a faithful brother \Nrather than to trust Paul. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.90,0:02:29.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Just as today, some believe \Neverything they read in the newspaper \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.90,0:02:32.34,Default,,0,0,0,,and they don’t even ask any questions.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.34,0:02:35.27,Default,,0,0,0,,So now here’s the question: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.27,0:02:37.74,Default,,0,0,0,,What were they going to do about it? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.74,0:02:39.74,Default,,0,0,0,,The elders had a suggestion. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.74,0:02:44.08,Default,,0,0,0,,They said: “We have four men \Nwho have put themselves under a vow.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.08,0:02:47.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And they wanted Paul \Nto take these men to the temple \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.32,0:02:49.35,Default,,0,0,0,,and pay their expenses. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.35,0:02:51.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Paul agreed. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.35,0:02:53.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, that took humility. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.42,0:02:58.06,Default,,0,0,0,,We all know how strongly Paul felt \Nabout keeping the Law, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.06,0:03:02.50,Default,,0,0,0,,and yet Paul was willing \Nto see the bigger picture. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.50,0:03:05.60,Default,,0,0,0,,He had strong feelings, \Nbut at the same time, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.60,0:03:08.24,Default,,0,0,0,,these Jews were probably new in the truth, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.24,0:03:11.51,Default,,0,0,0,,and Paul wanted to go as far as he could go \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.51,0:03:15.11,Default,,0,0,0,,so as not to stumble those new in the truth.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.11,0:03:18.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Now the vow. \NWhat was the vow? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.51,0:03:21.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Most scholars agree that the vow \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.78,0:03:25.09,Default,,0,0,0,,was probably a Nazarite vow. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.09,0:03:28.26,Default,,0,0,0,,And if it was, \Nthat was going to be tricky for Paul. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.26,0:03:33.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Because, you see, Nazarites \Nwere required to offer a sin offering \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.06,0:03:35.37,Default,,0,0,0,,when their vow came to a completion. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.37,0:03:37.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, Paul would never have agreed to that. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.80,0:03:38.97,Default,,0,0,0,,It would have showed— \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.97,0:03:42.24,Default,,0,0,0,,It would have shown disrespect \Nfor the sacrifice of Christ. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.24,0:03:45.64,Default,,0,0,0,,So Paul and those four men \Nwere going to have to be very careful \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.64,0:03:50.08,Default,,0,0,0,,about how far they would go \Nin the completion of this vow. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.08,0:03:52.45,Default,,0,0,0,,And we can be sure \Nthat they would never do anything \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.45,0:03:55.55,Default,,0,0,0,,that would go against their conscience.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.55,0:03:58.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we can see that on this occasion \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.15,0:04:00.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Paul went a long way \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.36,0:04:03.59,Default,,0,0,0,,so as not to stumble the Jews. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.59,0:04:05.70,Default,,0,0,0,,But on another occasion, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.70,0:04:08.90,Default,,0,0,0,,he refused to cater to the Jews. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.90,0:04:11.37,Default,,0,0,0,,We read about that in Galatians chapter 2. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.37,0:04:14.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s turn there. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.07,0:04:18.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Galatians chapter 2, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.54,0:04:24.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’ll read verses 11-14. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.27,0:04:51.24,Default,,0,0,0,,“fearing those of the circumcised class. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.24,0:04:54.54,Default,,0,0,0,,“The rest of the Jews also joined him \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.54,0:04:56.55,Default,,0,0,0,,“in putting on this pretense, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.55,0:05:00.05,Default,,0,0,0,,“so that even Barnabas \Nwas led along with them in their pretense. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.05,0:05:02.92,Default,,0,0,0,,“But when I saw \Nthat they were not walking in step \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.92,0:05:04.95,Default,,0,0,0,,“with the truth of the good news, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.95,0:05:07.02,Default,,0,0,0,,“I said to Cephas before them all: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.40,0:05:19.37,Default,,0,0,0,,So we see what was happening here. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.37,0:05:23.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Up till the time when men from James \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.84,0:06:03.91,Default,,0,0,0,,But at this point, Paul could not be \Nall things to all people. \N
