Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.12,0:20:26.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and for a while there were\Nno Guarani publications.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:26.08,0:20:28.50,Default,,0,0,0,,So how did this begin to change?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:28.50,0:20:30.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Can you tell us about that, Nanci?

Dialogue: 0,0:21:03.32,0:21:04.45,Default,,0,0,0,,But now at that point,

Dialogue: 0,0:21:23.43,0:21:25.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So what did you do?
