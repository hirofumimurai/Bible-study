Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.11,0:03:47.11,Default,,0,0,0,,He decided to obey Jehovah, \Nto leave Ur, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.69,0:04:04.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s read on a little further in verse 9. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.44,0:04:05.73,Default,,0,0,0,,There it says: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.73,0:04:08.23,Default,,0,0,0,,“By faith he lived as a foreigner \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.68,0:04:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, this is not a defining moment, is it? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.84,0:04:24.41,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a course of faithfulness, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.41,0:04:27.37,Default,,0,0,0,,day in, day out. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.37,0:04:29.39,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what’s the point? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.39,0:04:31.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, in the case of Abraham, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.39,0:04:34.96,Default,,0,0,0,,we remember \Nthat eventually he and his family \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.96,0:04:37.96,Default,,0,0,0,,crossed the Euphrates River \Nand into the Promised Land \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.96,0:04:41.11,Default,,0,0,0,,in the year 1943 B.C.E. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.11,0:04:45.89,Default,,0,0,0,,But he had to wait 25 years \Nbefore his son Isaac was born \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.89,0:04:48.55,Default,,0,0,0,,and then another 60 years \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.55,0:04:51.84,Default,,0,0,0,,before his grandsons \NEsau and Jacob were born. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.84,0:04:55.38,Default,,0,0,0,,And eventually, \Nhe died after being in the Promised Land \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.15,0:05:01.15,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what’s the point? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.15,0:05:04.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Although there was \Na definite decision he made \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.55,0:05:07.22,Default,,0,0,0,,—a defining moment in his life—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.22,0:05:10.31,Default,,0,0,0,,that was backed up as verse 9 says, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.31,0:05:12.48,Default,,0,0,0,,by his faithfulness \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.48,0:05:14.98,Default,,0,0,0,,—day in, day out—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.98,0:05:17.10,Default,,0,0,0,,serving Jehovah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.10,0:05:20.15,Default,,0,0,0,,So the lesson we learn from that is \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.15,0:05:23.52,Default,,0,0,0,,that it’s not just the defining moments \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.52,0:05:25.89,Default,,0,0,0,,that define who we are. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.89,0:05:29.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Rather, those moments and those decisions \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.70,0:05:33.10,Default,,0,0,0,,need to be backed up by faithful service. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.10,0:05:35.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s be quite frank. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.34,0:05:38.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Many of the life experiences \Nthat we read in The Watchtower \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.94,0:05:42.24,Default,,0,0,0,,may have a very exciting first paragraph. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.24,0:05:44.38,Default,,0,0,0,,“Yes, they put a gun to my head. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.38,0:05:45.58,Default,,0,0,0,,“Make your decision. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.48,0:05:52.42,Default,,0,0,0,,But then, \Nwhen you read the rest of the article, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.42,0:05:56.12,Default,,0,0,0,,nothing really exciting \Nhappened in that person’s life. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.12,0:05:58.66,Default,,0,0,0,,I’m sorry to say it. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.66,0:06:02.33,Default,,0,0,0,,That includes my life experience as well. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.33,0:06:03.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Why? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.76,0:06:06.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Because the majority of our lives \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.67,0:06:09.94,Default,,0,0,0,,are not involved with defining moments \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.94,0:06:12.31,Default,,0,0,0,,—exciting things that are happening. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.31,0:06:16.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Rather, they involve \Nour faithfulness to Jehovah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.68,0:06:20.85,Default,,0,0,0,,So we can’t just rely \Nupon these defining moments and say, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.85,0:06:23.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“Well, I made this decision \Nto serve Jehovah; \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.50,0:06:26.99,Default,,0,0,0,,I passed this test, \Nso everything is good.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.99,0:06:32.01,Default,,0,0,0,,No, we need to continue \Nto back up those defining moments \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.01,0:06:34.34,Default,,0,0,0,,with faithful service. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.34,0:06:36.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Remember that in the Scriptures, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.35,0:06:39.45,Default,,0,0,0,,there were many who had \Ndefining moments in their lives. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.45,0:06:41.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Take, for example, Solomon. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.62,0:06:45.46,Default,,0,0,0,,He had a defining moment, didn’t he, \Nwhen he prayed to Jehovah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.46,0:06:50.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and he was praised for the fact \Nthat he asked for wisdom rather than wealth? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.23,0:06:54.60,Default,,0,0,0,,But that wasn’t backed up by faithfulness. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.60,0:06:57.63,Default,,0,0,0,,Eventually, that defining moment in his life \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.63,0:07:00.93,Default,,0,0,0,,really wasn’t as valuable as it could’ve been \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.93,0:07:04.09,Default,,0,0,0,,because of his lack of faithfulness.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.09,0:07:06.63,Default,,0,0,0,,And what about Judas Iscariot? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.63,0:07:09.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Were there some defining moments in his life? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.98,0:07:13.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Obviously, he decided \Nto follow Jesus at one point. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.80,0:07:17.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And during that time, \Nwhen he faithfully followed Jesus, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.00,0:07:21.69,Default,,0,0,0,,no doubt, there were very exciting, \Ninteresting things that happened. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.69,0:07:26.03,Default,,0,0,0,,But again, \Nthose defining moments in his life \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.03,0:07:28.03,Default,,0,0,0,,proved to be of little value \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.03,0:07:31.72,Default,,0,0,0,,because of the lack \Nof faithfulness on his part. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.72,0:07:33.92,Default,,0,0,0,,So that helps us to understand \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.92,0:07:37.39,Default,,0,0,0,,why the apostle Paul \Nsaid some very interesting points \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.39,0:07:42.06,Default,,0,0,0,,just before he started this list \Nthat he gives us in Hebrews chapter 11. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.06,0:07:45.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s turn to Hebrews chapter 10, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.37,0:08:12.99,Default,,0,0,0,,now, that reminds us of what Jesus said \N
