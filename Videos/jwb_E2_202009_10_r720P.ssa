Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.03,0:00:13.33,Default,,0,0,0,,We remember what Micah 6:8 tells us:

Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.75,0:00:34.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Well now, what does modesty mean to you?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.02,0:00:37.72,Default,,0,0,0,,You probably, when you listened\Nto the comments this morning, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.72,0:00:40.89,Default,,0,0,0,,heard a variety of different definitions.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.80,0:00:55.97,Default,,0,0,0,,It said:\N“Modesty can mean a number of things, 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.97,0:01:00.07,Default,,0,0,0,,“such as a lack of conceit, or vanity, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.08,0:01:03.75,Default,,0,0,0,,“and a reluctance to boast \Nabout one’s abilities, 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.75,0:01:06.75,Default,,0,0,0,,“achievements, and possessions.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.78,0:01:34.15,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s a very interesting definition,\Nisn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.14,0:01:36.14,Default,,0,0,0,,And it kind of helps us to see

Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.94,0:02:04.78,Default,,0,0,0,,And sometimes it’s easier\Nto be able to see our physical limitations.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.77,0:02:08.97,Default,,0,0,0,,For example, if you’re not a strong swimmer, \Nprobably when you go to the beach,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.93,0:02:28.87,Default,,0,0,0,,But modesty goes far beyond

Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.44,0:02:34.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Now let’s look\Nat an example from the Scriptures
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.80,0:02:37.57,Default,,0,0,0,,that can help us to see this,\Nperhaps more clearly.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.57,0:02:42.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s go to 1 Samuel chapter 26,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.18,0:02:45.35,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’re going to start reading\Nhere at verse 7,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.35,0:02:48.72,Default,,0,0,0,,so 1 Samuel 26:7.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.72,0:02:52.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, just to set the context for you here,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.52,0:02:56.59,Default,,0,0,0,,you’ll remember that David\Nhad been hiding from King Saul,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.59,0:02:58.86,Default,,0,0,0,,who was seeking to kill him.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.86,0:03:01.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, a golden opportunity came for David
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.80,0:03:05.67,Default,,0,0,0,,to be able to put an end to Saul 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.67,0:03:10.44,Default,,0,0,0,,and to all of this hiding\Nthat David had had to be doing for so long.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.44,0:03:12.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, let’s read what it says,\Nverse 7: 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.44,0:03:16.54,Default,,0,0,0,,“So David and Abishai made their way\Nto the troops by night,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.55,0:03:20.09,Default,,0,0,0,,“and they found Saul lying asleep\Nin the camp enclosure 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.08,0:03:24.12,Default,,0,0,0,,“with his spear stuck to the ground\Nnext to his head; 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.12,0:03:28.46,Default,,0,0,0,,“Abner and the troops\Nwere lying all around him.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.46,0:03:30.46,Default,,0,0,0,,“Abishai now said to David: 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.46,0:03:35.03,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Today God has surrendered\Nyour enemy into your hand.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.03,0:03:38.33,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘And now, please,\Nlet me pin him to the ground 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.33,0:03:40.67,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘with the spear just once,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.67,0:03:44.54,Default,,0,0,0,,“and I will not need to do it twice.’
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.54,0:03:48.31,Default,,0,0,0,,“However, David said to Abishai: 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.31,0:03:50.85,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Do not harm him,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.85,0:03:54.72,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘for who can lift his hand\Nagainst the anointed of Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.72,0:03:56.86,Default,,0,0,0,,“and remain innocent?’
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.85,0:03:58.85,Default,,0,0,0,,“David continued:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.86,0:04:01.36,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘As surely as Jehovah is living,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.36,0:04:04.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Jehovah himself will strike him down,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.50,0:04:10.90,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘or he will go down into battle and perish.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.90,0:04:14.57,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.57,0:04:17.67,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘for me to lift my hand\Nagainst the anointed of Jehovah!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.67,0:04:22.41,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘So now take, please,\Nthe spear next to his head and the water jug,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.41,0:04:24.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and let us be on our way.’”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.95,0:04:27.59,Default,,0,0,0,,Well now, it would have been so easy
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.58,0:04:30.88,Default,,0,0,0,,for David to kill Saul, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.89,0:04:33.03,Default,,0,0,0,,But what helped David
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.02,0:04:36.89,Default,,0,0,0,,to act modestly in this situation?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.89,0:04:39.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s consider the first factor:
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.83,0:04:43.43,Default,,0,0,0,,David had to consider his own position,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.43,0:04:45.43,Default,,0,0,0,,or his own authority.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.44,0:04:50.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, had Jehovah\Ninstructed David to kill Saul?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.24,0:04:51.44,Default,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.44,0:04:55.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah had never assigned David\Nto carry out that task.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.78,0:04:59.62,Default,,0,0,0,,After all, Saul was anointed by Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.62,0:05:01.79,Default,,0,0,0,,to be the king of Israel,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.78,0:05:04.05,Default,,0,0,0,,so David acknowledged
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.05,0:05:07.49,Default,,0,0,0,,that he simply did not have\Nthe authority to kill Saul.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.49,0:05:10.23,Default,,0,0,0,,It was not his place.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.23,0:05:13.00,Default,,0,0,0,,But now, let’s consider a second factor.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.86,0:05:15.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice verse 10.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.37,0:05:17.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you remember what David said?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.57,0:05:20.51,Default,,0,0,0,,He said:\N“As surely as Jehovah is living, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.50,0:05:24.10,Default,,0,0,0,,“Jehovah himself will strike him down,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.11,0:05:27.11,Default,,0,0,0,,“or his day will come and he will die,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.11,0:05:30.35,Default,,0,0,0,,or he will go down into battle and perish.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.35,0:05:32.35,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, what’s the point?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.35,0:05:36.05,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, David had\Ncomplete confidence in Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.05,0:05:39.65,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, instead of taking matters\Ninto his own hands,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.66,0:05:41.93,Default,,0,0,0,,he had the total confidence
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.92,0:05:44.86,Default,,0,0,0,,that Jehovah was going\Nto handle this situation 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.86,0:05:48.20,Default,,0,0,0,,in his own way and in his own time
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.20,0:05:52.47,Default,,0,0,0,,David modestly trusted in Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.27,0:05:56.91,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, David acted modestly on that occasion.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.91,0:06:00.61,Default,,0,0,0,,But perhaps you can think\Nof a few other occasions later in his life
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.61,0:06:02.95,Default,,0,0,0,,when he didn’t act so modestly.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.95,0:06:05.09,Default,,0,0,0,,What’s the lesson?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.08,0:06:07.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Modesty is a quality
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.15,0:06:10.32,Default,,0,0,0,,that we must work hard to develop,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.32,0:06:14.89,Default,,0,0,0,,but we must also work hard\Nto maintain our modesty.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.89,0:06:18.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Otherwise, our minds can begin to focus
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.29,0:06:23.43,Default,,0,0,0,,on our strengths, on our talents,\Nand on our abilities
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.43,0:06:25.43,Default,,0,0,0,,to such an extent
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.44,0:06:30.14,Default,,0,0,0,,that we begin to get\Na very distorted view of self.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.14,0:06:34.28,Default,,0,0,0,,When that happens,\Nour modesty can begin to disappear,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.28,0:06:37.85,Default,,0,0,0,,and we can begin to behave presumptuously.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.85,0:06:42.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, who is one of the greatest examples\Nof this in the Bible?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.55,0:06:47.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, perhaps right away\Nyou think of the example of Uzziah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.56,0:06:51.73,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you go in your Bible\Nto 2 Chronicles chapter 26, 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.73,0:06:53.73,Default,,0,0,0,,let’s just review for a minute
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.73,0:06:57.23,Default,,0,0,0,,what we know about Uzziah\Nand what happened to him.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.23,0:07:01.73,Default,,0,0,0,,You see in 2 Chronicles 26:4—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.74,0:07:03.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you see what it says?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.44,0:07:09.31,Default,,0,0,0,,“continued to do what was right\Nin Jehovah’s eyes,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.31,0:07:12.38,Default,,0,0,0,,“just as his father Amaziah had done.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.38,0:07:16.79,Default,,0,0,0,,“And [you notice this]\Nhe kept searching for God

Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.73,0:07:30.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, do you hear the modesty there?\NDid you hear it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.03,0:07:34.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, you see, it says Uzziah\Nwas not a self-satisfied person
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.64,0:07:36.64,Default,,0,0,0,,at that point in his life.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.64,0:07:39.21,Default,,0,0,0,,He was searching for Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.21,0:07:42.78,Default,,0,0,0,,He felt the need for Jehovah’s guidance

Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.04,0:08:11.04,Default,,0,0,0,,He became so emboldened
