Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.58,0:03:16.12,Default,,0,0,0,,and there’s a particular aspect

Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.42,0:03:22.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, I know\Nthat quite a number of you have moved

Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.17,0:03:47.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and you might wonder why that is.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.04,0:03:49.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we’d never conclude\Nthat the translators
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.48,0:03:52.12,Default,,0,0,0,,had been unfaithful or careless

Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.86,0:04:02.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So we know there must be\Ngood reasons for the differences,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.96,0:04:05.30,Default,,0,0,0,,and the purpose of this brief discussion
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.30,0:04:08.54,Default,,0,0,0,,is to suggest what some\Nof those reasons might be.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.53,0:04:13.37,Default,,0,0,0,,First, a word about one\Nof the principles our translators follow.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.37,0:04:18.34,Default,,0,0,0,,They’re expected not only to render\Nthe thought in the English text accurately
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.34,0:04:21.98,Default,,0,0,0,,but also to keep in mind\Nthe way people speak.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.98,0:04:25.08,Default,,0,0,0,,So accuracy, clarity,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.08,0:04:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,and naturalness are needed
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.22,0:04:30.22,Default,,0,0,0,,while maintaining the dignity of our message.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.99,0:04:34.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what’s involved\Nin preparing a translation
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.19,0:04:37.99,Default,,0,0,0,,that’s both accurate and natural?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.99,0:04:41.33,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s not as if the translators\Nare like the Jewish scribes
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.33,0:04:44.03,Default,,0,0,0,,who made copies of the Hebrew Scriptures.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.03,0:04:46.17,Default,,0,0,0,,To make sure that the copies they made

Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.27,0:04:51.07,Default,,0,0,0,,they would count not only every word
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.07,0:04:54.44,Default,,0,0,0,,but also every letter\Nthey copied from the source text.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.48,0:04:57.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Translation is not like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.71,0:05:01.25,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s not as if there must be\Nseven words in the target language
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.25,0:05:03.62,Default,,0,0,0,,if there are seven words in English.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.62,0:05:06.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Every word in English may not be translated,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.66,0:05:10.00,Default,,0,0,0,,but the complete thought\Nof the English has to be there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.93,0:05:15.03,Default,,0,0,0,,English makes effective use of repetition.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.03,0:05:17.33,Default,,0,0,0,,What do we mean by that?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.33,0:05:22.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, you can write one sentence in English\Nand then repeat the same thought
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.34,0:05:24.41,Default,,0,0,0,,in slightly different words\Nin the next sentence,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.41,0:05:25.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and it sounds fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.94,0:05:27.94,Default,,0,0,0,,But in some languages,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.94,0:05:30.48,Default,,0,0,0,,to repeat a thought\Nwould be viewed as poor writing,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.48,0:05:34.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and that wouldn’t reflect well\Non our publications.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.02,0:05:36.56,Default,,0,0,0,,So in such cases,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.55,0:05:38.82,Default,,0,0,0,,the translators are allowed to combine
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.82,0:05:41.96,Default,,0,0,0,,two sentences into just one sentence
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.96,0:05:45.06,Default,,0,0,0,,as long as the thought\Nis completely conveyed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.06,0:05:49.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Or they might make two sentences\Nout of one long English sentence
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.77,0:05:52.44,Default,,0,0,0,,if that’s more natural in the language.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.44,0:05:56.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So you can’t always compare\Nthe length of an English paragraph
