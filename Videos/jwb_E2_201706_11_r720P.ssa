Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.72,0:02:17.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, in Paul’s time, \Nit included the Greek philosophies of Plato, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.78,0:03:20.55,Default,,0,0,0,,referred to 1 John 2:15, 16. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.55,0:03:22.65,Default,,0,0,0,,So let’s go there. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.65,0:03:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,What’s included \Nin “the elementary things of the world”? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.22,0:03:31.86,Default,,0,0,0,,First John 2:15, 16, \Nit says: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.48,0:03:55.39,Default,,0,0,0,,So The Watchtower introduces this \Nas not just religious thinking \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.39,0:03:57.52,Default,,0,0,0,,that could destabilize your faith; \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.52,0:04:01.02,Default,,0,0,0,,it could be desires of the flesh. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.77,0:04:20.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and so he uses that effectively. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.94,0:04:24.11,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, he maneuvers circumstances \Naround each one of us \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.11,0:04:26.38,Default,,0,0,0,,in order to try to work \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.39,0:04:33.39,Default,,0,0,0,,So that’s why the second sentence \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.82,0:05:01.85,Default,,0,0,0,,He wants to capture us. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.85,0:05:05.22,Default,,0,0,0,,We’ve heard of the poster \N“Wanted Dead or Alive.” \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.59,0:05:13.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, \Nit’s an interesting verse in 2 Timothy; \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.33,0:05:17.40,Default,,0,0,0,,it tells us why the Devil \Nwould prefer to have us alive. \N
