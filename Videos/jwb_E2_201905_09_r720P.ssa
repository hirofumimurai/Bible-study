Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.91,0:00:31.01,Default,,0,0,0,,and he begins this by letting us know

Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.92,0:00:35.92,Default,,0,0,0,,But in his discussion,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.92,0:00:39.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus explained something\Nquite different from that poll.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.09,0:00:41.16,Default,,0,0,0,,He explains that our happiness

Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.39,0:01:13.73,Default,,0,0,0,,since the Kingdom of the heavens\Nbelongs to them.”
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.72,0:01:15.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice the start:

Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.26,0:01:22.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Or, as the footnote says,

Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.77,0:01:30.11,Default,,0,0,0,,A literal beggar is likely,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.83,0:02:25.23,Default,,0,0,0,,And, of course, as we beg for holy spirit

Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.23,0:02:33.24,Default,,0,0,0,,well, obviously, now we’re happy\Nbecause it helps us to become better individuals
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.24,0:02:38.18,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’re better able to display\Nvarious aspects of the fruitage of the spirit.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.17,0:02:41.17,Default,,0,0,0,,And this becomes evident in our dealings with others.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.18,0:02:43.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus mentions some of these qualities in his sermon.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.68,0:02:48.69,Default,,0,0,0,,For example, if you look in verse 5,\Nwe develop the quality of mildness.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.42,0:02:55.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And then in verse 9,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.53,0:02:59.37,Default,,0,0,0,,we’re peaceable or we’re “peacemakers.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.36,0:03:04.37,Default,,0,0,0,,So we’re the ones that go about working\Nto initiate peace with one another.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.37,0:03:08.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And being in such a large family,\Ncertainly, can’t we see the benefit of this?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.87,0:03:13.37,Default,,0,0,0,,The more that we’re able to integrate these\Nqualities into our dealings with one another,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.38,0:03:16.22,Default,,0,0,0,,the happier we’re going to be and, of course,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.21,0:03:20.11,Default,,0,0,0,,the happier our Bethel family will be\Nas they deal with one another.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.12,0:03:25.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, next in the sermon\Nis our text for today, verse 8.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.65,0:03:56.65,Default,,0,0,0,,You know, the interesting thing\Nabout Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.65,0:04:01.66,Default,,0,0,0,,was that as he spoke with\Nthese large crowds that gathered from all over,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.43,0:04:07.37,Default,,0,0,0,,likely the majority\Nof the people in the crowds were happy.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.80,0:04:16.57,Default,,0,0,0,,They were thrilled about the possibility\Nof meeting Jesus and learning about him.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.57,0:04:19.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Many of them had probably been healed by him

Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.05,0:04:25.25,Default,,0,0,0,,But despite all of that joy and excitement,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.25,0:04:29.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus was helping them to see that real happiness,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.42,0:04:34.06,Default,,0,0,0,,genuine happiness, was more than how they felt
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.06,0:04:36.60,Default,,0,0,0,,or what they were doing at present.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.59,0:04:39.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Happiness was not just a joyous occasion.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.70,0:04:42.64,Default,,0,0,0,,It was more than just a good time with others.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.63,0:04:44.80,Default,,0,0,0,,It went much deeper than that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.80,0:04:47.14,Default,,0,0,0,,It involved their contentment,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.14,0:04:50.88,Default,,0,0,0,,satisfaction, fulfillment in life.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.87,0:04:55.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And all of those things are directly related\Nto one’s relationship with God.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.39,0:05:05.83,Default,,0,0,0,,it’s amazing how members of our brotherhood
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.82,0:05:09.29,Default,,0,0,0,,can experience hurt, disappointment,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.29,0:05:12.99,Default,,0,0,0,,ridicule, even severe persecution,

Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.20,0:05:18.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.20,0:05:21.97,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s because of their relationship and service to Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.67,0:05:28.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, this Sermon on the Mount was not\Nthe only time that Jesus focuses on this point.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.15,0:05:36.75,Default,,0,0,0,,and here we’ll see another account\Nwhere Jesus shows the connection

Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.59,0:05:42.63,Default,,0,0,0,,Luke chapter 11,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.63,0:05:46.47,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’ll look at verse 27.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.53,0:05:52.60,Default,,0,0,0,,It says: “Now as he was saying these things,\Na woman from the crowd called out to him:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.60,0:05:56.80,Default,,0,0,0,,‘Happy is the womb that carried you\Nand the breasts that nursed you!’”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.17,0:06:01.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Jewish women desired\Nthe privilege of being the mother of a prophet
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.78,0:06:03.82,Default,,0,0,0,,and particularly the Messiah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.81,0:06:05.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So this woman must have thought:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.88,0:06:08.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‘What a privilege for Mary.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.22,0:06:10.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‘How happy she must have been

Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.82,0:06:15.96,Default,,0,0,0,,And likely she was.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.96,0:06:18.60,Default,,0,0,0,,But yet, what did Jesus do?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.59,0:06:21.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Notice how he gently corrects the woman
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.96,0:06:26.53,Default,,0,0,0,,and directs her attention\Nas to the true source of happiness.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.54,0:06:28.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Verse 28:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.54,0:06:32.41,Default,,0,0,0,,“But he said: ‘No, rather,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.41,0:06:36.95,Default,,0,0,0,,happy are those\Nhearing the word of God and keeping it!’”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.15,0:06:41.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So again, Jesus emphasizes that true happiness
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.52,0:06:44.52,Default,,0,0,0,,is not found in any physical ties;
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.52,0:06:48.39,Default,,0,0,0,,it’s not found in privileges;\Nit’s not found in accomplishments.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.23,0:06:54.24,Default,,0,0,0,,True happiness is found\Nin being a true, faithful servant of God;
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.26,0:06:58.56,Default,,0,0,0,,because likely Jesus knew\Nthat if we were to gauge our happiness

Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.60,0:07:05.54,Default,,0,0,0,,you see, our life\Nbecomes one giant roller coaster of events.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.54,0:07:08.18,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s basically a bunch of highs and lows,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.18,0:07:11.82,Default,,0,0,0,,and we’re just waiting\Nfor the next big thing in life to make us happy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.81,0:07:14.18,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s a very tough way to live.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.18,0:07:16.38,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s a stressful way to live.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.39,0:07:20.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Jesus and his Father\N—they don’t want us to live this way.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.16,0:07:25.87,Default,,0,0,0,,How interesting that our Watchtower\Nfor this week really helped to capture this point.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.86,0:07:30.87,Default,,0,0,0,,And didn’t we learn that we \Ncannot gauge happiness by what we have,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.87,0:07:34.94,Default,,0,0,0,,by what we do, even by where we serve.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.97,0:07:40.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Because isn’t it true that the reality is there\Nare some things that are just not in our control?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.98,0:07:43.62,Default,,0,0,0,,And as our Watchtower so nicely highlighted,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.98,0:07:49.78,Default,,0,0,0,,And that’s going to affect, expand, or limit

Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.69,0:07:57.79,Default,,0,0,0,,If we just go back for a minute\Nto that survey that was taken,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.54,0:08:10.41,Default,,0,0,0,,And doesn’t that really highlight the disconnect
