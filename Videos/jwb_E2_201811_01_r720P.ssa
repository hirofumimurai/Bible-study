Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.26,0:05:48.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, to make it simple, \N‎I would put it this way: 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.36,0:05:52.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Preserve your love \N‎for Jehovah and for your brothers. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.87,0:05:57.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Joy in Jehovah’s service\N‎​—⁠never lose it!
