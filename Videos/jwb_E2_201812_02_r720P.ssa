Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.15,0:00:03.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The scripture that we’re considering this morning
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.72,0:00:05.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎raises a very interesting question,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.72,0:00:07.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and that is,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.72,0:00:11.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎How is it that we can ‘test Jehovah out’?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.16,0:00:15.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Didn’t Jesus say that we shouldn’t test Jehovah?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.83,0:00:18.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, the simple answer to that question
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.03,0:00:21.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎was given \N‎in The Watchtower back in 1957.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.30,0:00:25.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It simply stated: \N‎“There is a wrong way
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.08,0:00:28.88,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and a right way \N‎to put Jehovah to the test.”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.88,0:00:31.85,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, how do we know\N‎what is the right way
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.85,0:00:33.92,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and what is the wrong way?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.92,0:00:36.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, again, put simply,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.52,0:00:41.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎it means knowing the difference \N‎between faith and stupidity.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.66,0:00:45.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎When we consider \N‎what the Scriptures tell us,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.70,0:00:47.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎it helps us to see the line
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.70,0:00:51.27,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that is the demarcation \N‎between faith and stupidity.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.27,0:00:54.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Consider, first of all, the good way
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.50,0:00:56.80,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that we can test out Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.81,0:01:00.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎When we think about \N‎showing faith in Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.01,0:01:03.31,Default,,0,0,0,,‎having trust in him, \N‎and then obeying him
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.31,0:01:06.25,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—not waiting for Jehovah\N‎to make the first move
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.25,0:01:09.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but rather for us,\N‎first of all, to obey him,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.49,0:01:11.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to reach out \N‎and do what he wants us to do
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.86,0:01:15.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—that, in a figurative way,\N‎is putting him to the test,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.89,0:01:18.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎because he’s already promised to bless us.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.53,0:01:22.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎By us obeying him, \N‎it means that we are showing faith.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.33,0:01:26.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It also means that we \N‎don’t complain about the things
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.24,0:01:28.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that Jehovah \N‎allows to occur in our life,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.61,0:01:31.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and we don’t take unnecessary risks.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.54,0:01:33.94,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We don’t try to fool him
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.94,0:01:36.24,Default,,0,0,0,,‎by acting one way
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.25,0:01:38.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but then pretending to be another way.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.82,0:01:41.39,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So put quite simply, again,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.38,0:01:44.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the right way for us to test out Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.55,0:01:46.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎means to trust him,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.56,0:01:48.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to have faith in him,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.39,0:01:50.39,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to obey him
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.39,0:01:53.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎even if it may be difficult to do so.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.53,0:01:57.80,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, what about the wrong way\N‎to test out Jehovah? 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.80,0:02:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, if we were to selfishly complain
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.01,0:02:06.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎about the things \N‎that Jehovah allows to occur in our life
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.41,0:02:08.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or if we were to do
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.55,0:02:11.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎something stupid, \N‎something careless,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.65,0:02:16.62,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and expect that Jehovah \N‎is going to perform a miracle to save us
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.62,0:02:19.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or perhaps \N‎we keep pushing Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.82,0:02:24.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to do something\N‎that really is not in harmony with his will
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.23,0:02:27.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or if we try to fool him
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.30,0:02:29.67,Default,,0,0,0,,‎by pretending to serve him
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.67,0:02:32.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but actually are doing things\N‎that displease him,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.17,0:02:36.84,Default,,0,0,0,,‎all of those things really would be\N‎a stupid act on our part.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.84,0:02:40.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, what do we really need to consider\N‎with regard to this? 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.78,0:02:45.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, let’s think about when Jesus\N‎made that answer to Satan 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.48,0:02:47.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and said,\N‎‘You shouldn’t put Jehovah to the test.’
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.95,0:02:51.85,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Let’s have a look at the scripture \N‎that he based that comment on. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.86,0:02:56.43,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It’s found at Deuteronomy 6:16,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.43,0:03:00.27,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and this gives us \N‎a little context to the meaning.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.26,0:03:02.26,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In verse 16, it says:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.27,0:03:05.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“You must not \N‎put Jehovah your God to the test
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.07,0:03:08.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the way you put him \N‎to the test at Massah.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.61,0:03:10.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, really, what was it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.91,0:03:13.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that the Israelites did\N‎at this particular time
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.71,0:03:15.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎where the name of the location
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.91,0:03:18.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎where they were \N‎meant “Testing” or “Trial”?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.82,0:03:23.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, if we turn back to Exodus 17:7,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.69,0:03:27.76,Default,,0,0,0,,‎it gives us some idea \N‎of what this really involved.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.76,0:03:30.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Exodus 17:7:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.86,0:03:34.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“So he named the place\N‎Massah and Meribah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.16,0:03:36.66,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“because of the quarreling of the Israelites
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.67,0:03:39.64,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and because they put Jehovah to the test
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.64,0:03:44.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎by saying: \N‎‘Is Jehovah in our midst or not?’”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.64,0:03:47.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So, what did the Israelites do here?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.61,0:03:51.25,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Obviously, they didn’t trust Jehovah enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.25,0:03:54.15,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They didn’t have enough \N‎faith in Jehovah to realize
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.15,0:03:57.85,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that he wasn’t going \N‎to let them all die in the wilderness.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.85,0:04:00.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But they pushed him.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.02,0:04:02.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They wanted something immediately.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.33,0:04:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They wanted to satisfy their selfish desires.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.00,0:04:08.87,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, that’s a very good lesson for us\N‎—isn’t it?—
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.87,0:04:12.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎because this shows a lack of faith.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.34,0:04:16.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We could consider \N‎when the Israelites decided
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.74,0:04:19.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that they didn’t want to go\N‎into the Promised Land. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.38,0:04:22.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Remember, \N‎they were so upset with the report
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.65,0:04:26.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of the two good chieftains \N‎who had spied out the land
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.35,0:04:28.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that they wanted to kill them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.35,0:04:31.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They accepted the report\N‎of the ten who had a negative report.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.82,0:04:33.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And why did they do that?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.82,0:04:36.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Again, lack of faith in Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.29,0:04:40.03,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But then when Jehovah told them\N‎what was going to happen,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.03,0:04:42.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the punishment \N‎that was going to come on them,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.17,0:04:44.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎what did they do?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.17,0:04:47.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They went straight ahead \N‎and decided to go into the Promised Land.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.74,0:04:49.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And what happened?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.07,0:04:51.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎You see, it was an act of stupidity.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.41,0:04:53.41,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They were going on their own,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.41,0:04:56.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and Jehovah \N‎wasn’t going to give them support,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.05,0:04:57.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and that’s exactly what happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.78,0:04:59.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They were defeated.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.52,0:05:02.39,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So we see \N‎this is a very interesting example
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.39,0:05:05.49,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for us to understand the difference
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.49,0:05:07.76,Default,,0,0,0,,‎between the wrong way\N‎and the right way
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.76,0:05:09.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of putting Jehovah to the test.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.86,0:05:13.26,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And, more important, \N‎we need to remember
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.26,0:05:15.30,Default,,0,0,0,,‎how Jehovah feels
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.30,0:05:18.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎when we put him to the test in the wrong way.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.17,0:05:21.44,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We can see this \N‎if we turn to the book of Psalms,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.44,0:05:26.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Psalm 78:40, 41:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.74,0:05:30.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“How often they rebelled against him
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.35,0:05:34.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“in the wilderness \N‎and made him feel hurt in the desert!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.18,0:05:37.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Again and again \N‎they put God to the test,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.82,0:05:41.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and they grieved \N‎the Holy One of Israel.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.19,0:05:46.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Yes, by their lack of faith\N‎and by doing things
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.23,0:05:50.07,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that we could say \N‎irritated or disappointed Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.07,0:05:52.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎they grieved Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.10,0:05:54.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So this is \N‎a very important matter for us:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.37,0:05:57.61,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to realize the difference\N‎between the right and wrong way
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.61,0:06:00.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of putting Jehovah to the test.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.11,0:06:02.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎With regard to this,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.11,0:06:04.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎what sort of things \N‎do we need to avoid?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.11,0:06:07.85,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, we need to avoid dictating,\N‎or demanding,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.85,0:06:11.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that Jehovah do \N‎certain special things for us.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.29,0:06:14.56,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We need to avoid \N‎complaining to him
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.56,0:06:17.43,Default,,0,0,0,,‎about our expectations.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.43,0:06:22.27,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We need to avoid \N‎taking unnecessary risks and chances.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.27,0:06:25.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And that’s why we have \N‎a very important group of brothers
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.90,0:06:28.44,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that help to remind us about safety.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.44,0:06:31.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We do need to remember \N‎safety standards.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.57,0:06:34.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, some perhaps do not realize
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.58,0:06:36.58,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the difference between faith and stupidity,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.58,0:06:38.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and they may have the viewpoint,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.48,0:06:42.68,Default,,0,0,0,,‎‘Well, Jehovah will look after me \N‎if I’m doing whatever I’m doing.’
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.69,0:06:47.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But notice what the Awake! magazine\N‎said back in 1953. 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.16,0:06:52.13,Default,,0,0,0,,‎It was in the article entitled \N‎“You Must Not Put God to the Test.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.13,0:06:54.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And this is what it says:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.16,0:06:58.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“It really amounts \N‎to considering ourselves very important
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.73,0:07:02.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“when we act as though \N‎nothing could happen to us
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.24,0:07:04.51,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“because we are serving Jehovah. . . .
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.51,0:07:07.05,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“We dare not put God to the test
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.04,0:07:11.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“with irrational actions and carelessness.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.11,0:07:13.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“We simply cannot expect God
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.38,0:07:17.62,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“to furnish us angels \N‎to keep us from harm and accident
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.62,0:07:20.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎in spite of what we may or may not do.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.26,0:07:24.96,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, that’s a good reminder\N‎for all of us, isn’t it? 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.96,0:07:26.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I know, as a missionary,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.73,0:07:29.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎this was a lesson \N‎I had to learn over the years
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.57,0:07:32.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—the difference \N‎between faith and stupidity.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.54,0:07:35.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎When I look back on the first few years
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.71,0:07:37.78,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I was in my missionary assignment
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.77,0:07:39.77,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and some of the scary things we did
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.78,0:07:44.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—jumping off ships into little boats \N‎in the open sea without life jackets—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.58,0:07:48.15,Default,,0,0,0,,‎at the time, \N‎I thought it was an act of faith,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.15,0:07:51.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but now I view it a little differently.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.42,0:07:55.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎So we do need to be careful \N‎to measure what we’re doing
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.69,0:07:58.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and see if it really is an act of faith
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.90,0:08:02.50,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or if it’s just doing something stupid.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.50,0:08:06.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Jesus showed great wisdom\N‎in this regard, didn’t he? 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.54,0:08:10.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎When he served Jehovah\N‎here on earth,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.17,0:08:14.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎no doubt many times \N‎his life was endangered
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.18,0:08:17.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎because the Pharisees \N‎and the Sadducees opposed him.
