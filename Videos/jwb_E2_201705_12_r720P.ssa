Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.28,0:00:04.32,Default,,0,0,0,,In your ministry, have you ever met someone \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.32,0:00:07.06,Default,,0,0,0,,who strongly believes that we are still \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.06,0:00:09.59,Default,,0,0,0,,under the Ten Commandments? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.59,0:00:12.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, that can happen at times \Nbecause many people\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.83,0:00:15.77,Default,,0,0,0,,—especially in the southern parts \Nof this country—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.77,0:00:18.60,Default,,0,0,0,,feel very strongly \Nabout the Ten Commandments. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.60,0:00:21.17,Default,,0,0,0,,There are even legal battles going on \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.17,0:00:24.27,Default,,0,0,0,,as to whether monuments \Ndisplaying the Ten Commandments \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.27,0:00:27.88,Default,,0,0,0,,can be displayed \Non government property. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.88,0:00:31.65,Default,,0,0,0,,And, of course, many people feel \Nthat the Ten Commandments \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.65,0:00:35.49,Default,,0,0,0,,are basically what was used \Nfor the Constitution \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.49,0:00:37.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and for the laws of many countries.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.65,0:00:41.99,Default,,0,0,0,,So at one point, perhaps, \Na person might say to us, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.99,0:00:46.16,Default,,0,0,0,,‘Do you believe that we are still \Nunder the Ten Commandments?’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.16,0:00:49.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps you may diplomatically answer, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.17,0:00:53.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‘Well, I believe we are under the principles \Nof the Ten Commandments \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.57,0:00:56.67,Default,,0,0,0,,and the law of love\N—the law of the Christ.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.67,0:00:58.88,Default,,0,0,0,,But a person may push \Nthe point and say, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.88,0:01:02.91,Default,,0,0,0,,‘But do you believe the Ten Commandments \Nare binding today?’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.91,0:01:06.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, when we give them \Nan explanation from the Scriptures, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.45,0:01:10.82,Default,,0,0,0,,perhaps they may feel disappointed \Nand maybe they realize \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.82,0:01:14.72,Default,,0,0,0,,that there’s a verse in the Bible \Nthat they feel supports their belief.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.72,0:01:16.76,Default,,0,0,0,,So let’s take our Bibles \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.76,0:01:20.43,Default,,0,0,0,,and turn to Matthew chapter five,\Nthe Sermon on the Mount,  \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.43,0:01:23.97,Default,,0,0,0,,from which our text \Nis taken this morning. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.97,0:01:26.54,Default,,0,0,0,,And perhaps they may point \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.54,0:01:29.54,Default,,0,0,0,,to verses 17 and 18. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.54,0:01:31.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Now that reads: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.85,0:01:39.45,Default,,0,0,0,,“I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.62,0:01:50.39,Default,,0,0,0,,until all things take place.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.39,0:01:54.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, this person, \Nin presenting their explanation, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.33,0:01:57.60,Default,,0,0,0,,may show that they believe \Nthis expression “fulfilled” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.60,0:02:00.57,Default,,0,0,0,,means “established permanently.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.57,0:02:03.34,Default,,0,0,0,,And even some Bible commentaries \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.34,0:02:06.61,Default,,0,0,0,,say that this involves total commitment. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.61,0:02:10.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, how would you answer \Nthe person at that stage? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.08,0:02:12.08,Default,,0,0,0,,How can we help them?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.08,0:02:15.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps you might take them \Nthrough a series of scriptures, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.45,0:02:18.96,Default,,0,0,0,,such as Romans 10:4 \Nwhere it says: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.96,0:02:20.96,Default,,0,0,0,,“Christ is the end of the Law.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.96,0:02:25.66,Default,,0,0,0,,You might read Galatians 4:4,5 \Nwhere it says, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.66,0:02:28.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‘those under the law were released.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.33,0:02:33.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Or Ephesians 2:15 where it speaks \Nof the Law being “abolished.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.20,0:02:35.91,Default,,0,0,0,,But if you’ve done that, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.91,0:02:38.51,Default,,0,0,0,,perhaps you’ve had \Nthe same experience that I have\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.51,0:02:42.71,Default,,0,0,0,,—that a person may agree \Nwith those scriptures but say: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.71,0:02:46.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‘That’s not referring \Nto the Ten Commandments. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.08,0:02:50.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‘That’s referring to all the other laws \Nin the Mosaic Law arrangement. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.65,0:02:53.79,Default,,0,0,0,,But the Ten Commandments \Nremain forever.’\N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.79,0:02:58.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, how can you help someone \Nto reason on that matter? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.43,0:03:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s look back again \Nat Matthew chapter 5, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.60,0:03:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and we notice there \Nin verses 17 and 18, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.00,0:03:10.31,Default,,0,0,0,,it mentions that Jesus came \N“not to destroy, but to fulfill.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.31,0:03:14.58,Default,,0,0,0,,And we could ask the person \Nhow they understand the word “fulfill”\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.58,0:03:16.58,Default,,0,0,0,,—what they feel that means. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.58,0:03:20.55,Default,,0,0,0,,And perhaps they might say, \N‘Established permanently.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.55,0:03:22.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, then we could point out \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.65,0:03:27.16,Default,,0,0,0,,that Jesus then continues to talk \Nabout various aspects of the Law. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.16,0:03:30.86,Default,,0,0,0,,If we look at verse 21, \Nwhat do we notice? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.86,0:03:34.26,Default,,0,0,0,,“You heard that it was said \Nto those of ancient times: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.26,0:03:36.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‘You must not murder.’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.33,0:03:40.40,Default,,0,0,0,,So, yes, this is one \Nof the Ten Commandments. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.40,0:03:44.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Interestingly, the study Bible has a note \Non this verse that says \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.84,0:03:47.71,Default,,0,0,0,,this phrase,\N “You heard that is was said:\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.71,0:03:52.18,Default,,0,0,0,,“. . . can refer both to things stated \Nin the inspired Hebrew Scriptures \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.18,0:03:54.82,Default,,0,0,0,,and to teachings of Jewish tradition.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.82,0:03:57.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we’ll see this as we go on. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.15,0:03:59.99,Default,,0,0,0,,If we go to verse 23, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.99,0:04:02.59,Default,,0,0,0,,what does it talk about here? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.59,0:04:05.83,Default,,0,0,0,,“If, then, you are bringing \Nyour gift to the altar \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.83,0:04:09.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and there you remember your brother \Nhas something against you.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.23,0:04:12.20,Default,,0,0,0,,This is not part \Nof the Ten Commandments, is it? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.20,0:04:16.11,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s talking about the arrangements \Nfor sacrifices. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.11,0:04:19.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Then, if we look at verse 27: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.14,0:04:23.65,Default,,0,0,0,,“You heard that it was said: \N‘You must not commit adultery.’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.65,0:04:26.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, again we have \Nthe Ten Commandments. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.72,0:04:31.45,Default,,0,0,0,,But if we look at verse 31, \NJesus here says: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.45,0:04:35.46,Default,,0,0,0,,“Moreover, it was said: \N‘Whoever divorces his wife, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.46,0:04:38.26,Default,,0,0,0,,let him give her \Na certificate of divorce.’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.26,0:04:41.56,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s not one \Nof the Ten Commandments, is it? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.56,0:04:45.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Reading on further in verse 33, \Nit says: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.17,0:04:48.37,Default,,0,0,0,,“Again you heard that it was said \Nto those of ancient times: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.27,0:04:54.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Again, not one \Nof the Ten Commandments. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.71,0:04:58.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Verse 38: \N“You heard that it was said: \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.72,0:05:04.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Again, not one \Nof the Ten Commandments. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.85,0:05:08.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And then we come to the scripture \Nwe’ve been considering this morning \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.16,0:05:10.16,Default,,0,0,0,,in verse 43:\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.16,0:05:12.23,Default,,0,0,0,, “You heard that it was said: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.23,0:05:16.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‘You must love your neighbor \Nand hate your enemy.’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.40,0:05:19.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, when we consider this\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.14,0:05:22.34,Default,,0,0,0,,—we look at the study Bible notes \Non this verse—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.34,0:05:25.38,Default,,0,0,0,,it makes this comment \Nabout “hate your enemy.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.38,0:05:29.05,Default,,0,0,0,,It says: “The Mosaic Law \Ncontained no such command. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.05,0:05:32.95,Default,,0,0,0,,“Some Jewish rabbis believed \Nthat the command to love their neighbor \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.95,0:05:36.15,Default,,0,0,0,,implied that they should hate their enemy.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.15,0:05:41.02,Default,,0,0,0,,So this wasn’t really part \Nof the Law that Moses gave.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.02,0:05:43.73,Default,,0,0,0,,But what do we see from this? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.73,0:05:48.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, if a person argues very strongly \Nthat the word “fulfilled,” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.53,0:05:50.73,Default,,0,0,0,,when Jesus is talking about the Law, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.73,0:05:54.94,Default,,0,0,0,,applies to the Ten Commandments only\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.94,0:05:58.31,Default,,0,0,0,,—we look down here—\NJesus when he’s talking about the Law, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.31,0:06:00.88,Default,,0,0,0,,doesn’t just talk \Nabout the Ten Commandments, does he? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.88,0:06:05.52,Default,,0,0,0,,He talks about all these things, \Nincluding even the oral tradition. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.52,0:06:10.45,Default,,0,0,0,,So if a person were to believe \Nthat Jesus’ words, when saying “fulfilled,”  \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.45,0:06:15.43,Default,,0,0,0,,refer to absolutely establishing \Nsomething permanently, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.43,0:06:18.29,Default,,0,0,0,,would also feel\N—or have to feel—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.29,0:06:21.83,Default,,0,0,0,,that he’s referring to this law \Nof “eye for eye, tooth for tooth” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.83,0:06:26.04,Default,,0,0,0,,when, in fact, he showed \Nsomething better than that, didn’t he? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.04,0:06:29.74,Default,,0,0,0,,And the same too \Nwith the scripture for today’s text.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.74,0:06:31.74,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what do we see here? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.74,0:06:35.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we can’t make \Nthat comment about Jesus’ words. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.65,0:06:37.98,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what does it mean \Nwhen it says, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.98,0:06:41.28,Default,,0,0,0,,‘to fulfill and not to destroy’? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.28,0:06:44.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps a simple illustration \Nwould help us. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.62,0:06:48.16,Default,,0,0,0,,If someone signs \Na contract as a builder \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.16,0:06:50.66,Default,,0,0,0,,to build a home \Nfor someone else, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.66,0:06:54.73,Default,,0,0,0,,what does it mean \Nto destroy the contract? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.73,0:06:59.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, perhaps it means ripping it up, \Nburning it, getting rid of it\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.24,0:07:02.21,Default,,0,0,0,,—certainly not building the house. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.21,0:07:04.51,Default,,0,0,0,,But on the other hand, \Nwhat does it mean \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.51,0:07:08.08,Default,,0,0,0,,to fulfill the contract \Nto build the house? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.08,0:07:11.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it means \Nthat the person builds the house. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.28,0:07:13.65,Default,,0,0,0,,But once the house is built, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.65,0:07:18.32,Default,,0,0,0,,then the contract \Nis completed, or fulfilled. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.32,0:07:22.19,Default,,0,0,0,,This person isn’t under obligation \Nto continue over and over again \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.19,0:07:27.20,Default,,0,0,0,,So perhaps an illustration \Nsuch as that \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.20,0:07:30.73,Default,,0,0,0,,may help someone \Nof humble heart \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.73,0:07:32.94,Default,,0,0,0,,to see that when Jesus said \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.77,0:07:38.61,Default,,0,0,0,,that he wasn’t there \Nto eradicate the Law. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.61,0:07:41.41,Default,,0,0,0,,In Galatians 4, it mentions \Nhe was ‘born under Law.’ \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.41,0:07:45.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So he had to fulfill, or complete, \Nor do what the Law stated. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.78,0:07:48.99,Default,,0,0,0,,But, of course, the other scriptures \Nhelp us when they tell us \N

Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.02,0:07:53.99,Default,,0,0,0,,that the Christ \Nwas the end to the Law.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.99,0:07:56.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, perhaps a person \Nmight still find this \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.69,0:07:59.03,Default,,0,0,0,,a little difficult to comprehend. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.03,0:08:01.63,Default,,0,0,0,,One final scripture we could share with them \N
