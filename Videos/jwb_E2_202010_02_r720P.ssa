Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.11,0:04:54.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s quickly summarize\Nthose three temptations.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.44,0:04:59.04,Default,,0,0,0,,First, Jesus was asked\Nto turn stones into bread
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.05,0:05:02.32,Default,,0,0,0,,at a time when he was extremely hungry.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.32,0:05:07.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Basically, Satan appealed\Nto Jesus’ desire for food.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.02,0:05:10.62,Default,,0,0,0,,However, Jesus immediately rejected\Nthe temptation
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.63,0:05:14.63,Default,,0,0,0,,to satisfy that desire\Nin an inappropriate way.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.03,0:05:18.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Second, Satan challenged Jesus
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.60,0:05:21.80,Default,,0,0,0,,to throw himself off the temple battlement.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.80,0:05:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Jesus rejected this temptation as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.01,0:05:26.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.41,0:05:30.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Because he knew\Nthat such a spectacular display
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.61,0:05:35.02,Default,,0,0,0,,would amount\Nto a prideful testing of Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.02,0:05:36.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Finally,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.19,0:05:38.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Satan offered Jesus
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.29,0:05:42.06,Default,,0,0,0,,“all the kingdoms of the world\Nand their glory.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.06,0:05:44.10,Default,,0,0,0,,But at what price?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.19,0:05:48.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Satan demanded that Jesus offer him in return
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.20,0:05:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,an act of worship.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.57,0:05:52.74,Default,,0,0,0,,What was Jesus’ answer?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.74,0:05:57.11,Default,,0,0,0,,He flatly refused, saying: “Go away, Satan!”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.88,0:06:01.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Have you had to face similar temptations?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.24,0:06:03.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, you might quickly answer:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.25,0:06:06.09,Default,,0,0,0,,‘No one has asked me\Nto turn stones into bread
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.08,0:06:08.08,Default,,0,0,0,,‘or to jump off a tall building.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.39,0:06:17.46,Default,,0,0,0,,But notice, please, we said “similar,”\Nnot “the same.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.46,0:06:20.73,Default,,0,0,0,,So have you faced similar temptations?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.67,0:06:32.08,Default,,0,0,0,,It may have been temptations\Nto commit immorality
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.08,0:06:34.38,Default,,0,0,0,,or temptations that appealed to greed
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.38,0:06:38.42,Default,,0,0,0,,or an unbalanced concern\Nabout material things.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.41,0:06:43.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Other temptations may have appealed\Nto our pride or tested our humility
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.32,0:06:46.26,Default,,0,0,0,,or our desire to impress others.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.02,0:06:51.39,Default,,0,0,0,,And who of us hasn’t been tempted\Nby opportunities
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.39,0:06:53.39,Default,,0,0,0,,offered to us by Satan’s world
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.40,0:06:57.44,Default,,0,0,0,,for wealth, power, or position?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.90,0:07:04.67,Default,,0,0,0,,remember Jesus’ words:\N“Pray continually,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.01,0:07:13.01,Default,,0,0,0,,But were those the only temptations\Nthat Jesus faced?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.38,0:07:15.85,Default,,0,0,0,,How do we know?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.85,0:07:17.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, notice Luke’s words

Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.84,0:07:39.81,Default,,0,0,0,,He must have because of what we’re told
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.81,0:07:43.91,Default,,0,0,0,,at Hebrews 4:15.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.91,0:07:45.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s read that:

Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.84,0:08:13.14,Default,,0,0,0,,One example occurred in 32 C.E.,
