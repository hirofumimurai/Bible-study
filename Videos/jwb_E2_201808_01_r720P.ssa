Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.55,0:03:23.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎As a world conqueror,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.65,0:03:27.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎figuratively He has plundered captives

Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.43,0:03:35.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎How useful are these “gifts in men”?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.70,0:03:40.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, please look \Nat verses 11 and 12 for the answer:

Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.49,0:04:05.40,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Notice, they would be “evangelizers”

Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.40,0:04:11.13,Default,,0,0,0,,‎in the all-important preaching \Nand disciple-making work.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.13,0:04:13.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They do not simply say to the publishers,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.35,0:04:28.95,Default,,0,0,0,,‎They’re also “shepherds”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.95,0:04:31.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—protecting the flock from Satan
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.89,0:04:35.93,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the “murderer,” \N“serpent,” “dragon,” and “lion.”

Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.87,0:04:55.81,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Let’s go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.81,0:04:58.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and let’s get the answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.48,0:05:00.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎At 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.48,0:05:04.02,Default,,0,0,0,,‎beginning in verse number 12,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.02,0:05:06.29,Default,,0,0,0,,‎notice what Jehovah says:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.29,0:05:09.09,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Now we request you, brothers,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.09,0:05:12.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“to show respect
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.06,0:05:15.50,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“for those who are working hard among you
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.50,0:05:18.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and presiding over you in the Lord
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.74,0:05:21.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and admonishing you;
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.17,0:05:25.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and to give them extraordinary consideration
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.74,0:05:28.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“in love because of their work.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.75,0:05:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Be peaceable with one another.”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.28,0:05:37.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Notice, we’re told to “show respect”
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.79,0:05:39.86,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for these dear brothers.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.86,0:05:43.69,Default,,0,0,0,,‎But now, let’s move to a vital question,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.69,0:05:47.70,Default,,0,0,0,,‎How can we show, demonstrate,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.70,0:05:50.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that we do deeply respect
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.23,0:05:53.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and appreciate these dear brothers?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.00,0:05:55.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The first way:
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.00,0:05:59.28,Default,,0,0,0,,‎by wholeheartedly cooperating with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.28,0:06:04.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Please turn to Hebrews 13:17,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.62,0:06:08.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and this scripture describes how deep
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.89,0:06:13.19,Default,,0,0,0,,‎our cooperation should be, verse 17:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.19,0:06:15.83,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“Be obedient
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.83,0:06:19.06,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“to those who are taking the lead among you
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.06,0:06:22.17,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“and be submissive,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.17,0:06:25.27,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“for they are keeping watch over you
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.27,0:06:28.57,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“as those who will render an account,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.57,0:06:32.34,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“so that they may do this \Nwith joy and not with sighing,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.34,0:06:36.48,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for this would be damaging to you.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.85,0:06:41.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Notice, we are told to “be obedient.”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.32,0:06:44.59,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Clearly, this means \Nthat we’re supposed to comply with,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.59,0:06:47.36,Default,,0,0,0,,‎or obey, what they tell us.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.36,0:06:50.26,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Of course, that would be with the proviso:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.26,0:06:53.90,Default,,0,0,0,,‎unless they tell us to do \Nsomething that is unscriptural.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.90,0:06:57.33,Default,,0,0,0,,‎And, of course, that would be extremely rare.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.33,0:07:01.54,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We’re also told to “be submissive.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.54,0:07:04.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎This includes the attitude
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.11,0:07:06.84,Default,,0,0,0,,‎with which we’re to be obedient
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.84,0:07:11.55,Default,,0,0,0,,‎—doing so with a yielding, positive attitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.58,0:07:15.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Would it be possible to be obedient
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.35,0:07:17.82,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but not submissive?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.82,0:07:19.89,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Well, what if we said:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.89,0:07:24.79,Default,,0,0,0,,‎“OK. I’ll do what the elders suggest.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.79,0:07:29.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎I don’t want to do it, but I’ll do it.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.73,0:07:33.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We would be obedient but not submissive.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.74,0:07:36.01,Default,,0,0,0,,‎However, Jehovah tells us
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.01,0:07:39.44,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to display both of these qualities.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.44,0:07:42.75,Default,,0,0,0,,‎We should be obedient and submissive
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.75,0:07:46.18,Default,,0,0,0,,‎even if what the elders are asking us to do
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.18,0:07:50.65,Default,,0,0,0,,‎is not the best, \Nmost efficient way to do something.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.65,0:07:53.96,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Permit me to illustrate this point.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.96,0:07:58.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Admittedly, the illustration \Nis somewhat exaggerated,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.73,0:08:01.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎but hopefully it will make the point.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.53,0:08:05.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Please imagine that the elders decide
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.00,0:08:07.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that the outside of the Kingdom Hall
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.74,0:08:11.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎needs to be painted \Nand that all the publishers
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.71,0:08:15.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎will be given \Na small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.11,0:08:17.25,Default,,0,0,0,,‎with which to paint.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.25,0:08:19.42,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, what could happen?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.42,0:08:22.22,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The publishers could get all upset
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.22,0:08:24.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎concerning this request of the elders,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.72,0:08:29.23,Default,,0,0,0,,‎saying, “It is ridiculous \Nthat the elders want us
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.23,0:08:32.53,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to paint \Nwith a small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush!”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.53,0:08:36.80,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Consequently, some could start campaigning
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.80,0:08:41.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for the right for everyone \Nto use a six-inch (15 cm) paintbrush.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.74,0:08:46.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Others might campaign for using paint rollers
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.74,0:08:49.71,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to roll the paint on the Kingdom Hall.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.71,0:08:53.52,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Still others \Nmight start trying to build support
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.52,0:08:57.72,Default,,0,0,0,,‎for renting and using a paint sprayer
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.72,0:09:00.56,Default,,0,0,0,,‎to spray the paint on the Kingdom Hall.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.56,0:09:04.13,Default,,0,0,0,,‎In another camp, \Nones might champion the idea
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.13,0:09:06.63,Default,,0,0,0,,‎of hiring out to a contractor
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.63,0:09:09.10,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the painting of the Kingdom Hall,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.10,0:09:13.00,Default,,0,0,0,,‎while another group is promoting the idea
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.00,0:09:17.11,Default,,0,0,0,,‎that the Kingdom Hall \Ndoesn’t even need to be painted.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.11,0:09:20.38,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Now, what would be the outcome?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.38,0:09:23.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‎The congregation would be divided,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.45,0:09:26.35,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the Kingdom Hall would never get painted,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.35,0:09:30.32,Default,,0,0,0,,‎publishers could end up \Nstumbled right out of the truth,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.32,0:09:33.46,Default,,0,0,0,,‎the elders would be very discouraged,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.46,0:09:35.99,Default,,0,0,0,,‎Jehovah would be sad,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.99,0:09:40.73,Default,,0,0,0,,‎and Satan would be made very happy.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.73,0:09:47.74,Default,,0,0,0,,‎what if everyone humbly supported \Nthe elders, perhaps thinking:
