Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.08,0:00:03.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, there are many reasons
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.42,0:00:06.99,Default,,0,0,0,,why all of us want to cultivate humility,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.99,0:00:10.16,Default,,0,0,0,,but what would you say is the foremost reason?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.16,0:00:14.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s get the answer from James 4:6
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.20,0:00:16.07,Default,,0,0,0,,—the “b” part.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.07,0:00:21.08,Default,,0,0,0,,It says:\N“God opposes the haughty ones,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.84,0:00:25.68,Default,,0,0,0,,“but he gives undeserved kindness
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.68,0:00:27.72,Default,,0,0,0,,to the humble ones.”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.71,0:00:32.25,Default,,0,0,0,,So if we don’t have humility,\NJehovah is going to oppose us.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.25,0:00:36.92,Default,,0,0,0,,If we do,\Nhe’s going to give us undeserved kindness.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.92,0:00:39.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Obviously, that’s the main reason,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.76,0:00:41.76,Default,,0,0,0,,even though there are many others,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.76,0:00:43.93,Default,,0,0,0,,we want to cultivate humility.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.93,0:00:46.33,Default,,0,0,0,,But as you know, once humble
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.33,0:00:49.53,Default,,0,0,0,,does not necessarily mean always humble.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.53,0:00:53.97,Default,,0,0,0,,The Bible contains many examples\Nof ones who started out humble,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.97,0:00:57.61,Default,,0,0,0,,but somewhere along the way,\Nthey lost their humility.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.61,0:01:00.81,Default,,0,0,0,,And you probably can think\Nof modern-day examples
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.81,0:01:03.05,Default,,0,0,0,,of ones who lost their humility.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.05,0:01:06.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, in some cases,\Nperhaps they regained it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.12,0:01:09.16,Default,,0,0,0,,But in other cases,\Npride proved to be
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.15,0:01:11.79,Default,,0,0,0,,their ultimate downfall.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.79,0:01:13.86,Default,,0,0,0,,But now think about this:
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.86,0:01:18.23,Default,,0,0,0,,In a case of one who loses his humility,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.23,0:01:21.30,Default,,0,0,0,,does it just happen automatically?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.30,0:01:24.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, isn’t it true that in most cases
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.87,0:01:28.44,Default,,0,0,0,,some situation develops in that person’s life
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.44,0:01:30.91,Default,,0,0,0,,that proves to be a catalyst
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.91,0:01:34.88,Default,,0,0,0,,that causes that person to lose his humility?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.88,0:01:36.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So this being the case,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.88,0:01:39.88,Default,,0,0,0,,let us discuss five situations
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.88,0:01:42.25,Default,,0,0,0,,that could develop in our lives
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.25,0:01:44.29,Default,,0,0,0,,and test our humility,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.29,0:01:47.49,Default,,0,0,0,,and if we’re not careful,\Ncause us to lose it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.49,0:01:51.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Number one:\Nwhen we receive privileges
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.73,0:01:54.93,Default,,0,0,0,,or added responsibilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.93,0:01:58.50,Default,,0,0,0,,In this regard,\Nlet’s think for a moment about Hagar.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.50,0:02:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, the Insight book suggests
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.00,0:02:05.77,Default,,0,0,0,,that she perhaps became\Nthe maidservant to Sarah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.78,0:02:09.42,Default,,0,0,0,,during a time of great famine in Egypt.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.41,0:02:11.95,Default,,0,0,0,,So in that circumstance,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.95,0:02:14.72,Default,,0,0,0,,she would’ve been\Nvery appreciative, very humble.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.72,0:02:18.96,Default,,0,0,0,,But now when she became\Nthe secondary wife of Abraham
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.96,0:02:22.80,Default,,0,0,0,,and found out she was pregnant,\Nthen what happened?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.79,0:02:24.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Genesis 16:4 says:
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.93,0:02:28.03,Default,,0,0,0,,“When she realized that she was pregnant,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.03,0:02:31.33,Default,,0,0,0,,she began to despise her mistress.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.33,0:02:34.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, with her new honored status,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.54,0:02:36.54,Default,,0,0,0,,she lost her humility;
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.54,0:02:40.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and appropriately,\NJehovah’s angel gave her some counsel.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.24,0:02:43.08,Default,,0,0,0,,The angel said:\N“Return to your mistress
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.08,0:02:47.72,Default,,0,0,0,,and humble yourself under her hand.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.72,0:02:50.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Hagar well illustrates
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.55,0:02:53.29,Default,,0,0,0,,that a person who has had a good heart
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.29,0:02:55.36,Default,,0,0,0,,can lose their humility
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.36,0:03:00.30,Default,,0,0,0,,upon receiving privileges or authority
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.30,0:03:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,,—an honored position.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.00,0:03:06.74,Default,,0,0,0,,But now let’s take\Nthe second humility-testing situation:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.74,0:03:10.28,Default,,0,0,0,,when we receive success,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.27,0:03:14.04,Default,,0,0,0,,or achieve success, in some endeavor.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.04,0:03:16.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, let’s think about Uzziah in this regard.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.98,0:03:19.52,Default,,0,0,0,,In 2 Chronicles 26,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.52,0:03:22.96,Default,,0,0,0,,if you just scan down through verses 3 to 5,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.95,0:03:25.52,Default,,0,0,0,,it shows that he started out very humble.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.52,0:03:28.29,Default,,0,0,0,,He “was 16 years old when he became king,”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.29,0:03:32.69,Default,,0,0,0,,and in verse 4, “continued to do\Nwhat was right in Jehovah’s eyes.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.70,0:03:34.70,Default,,0,0,0,,At the end of verse 5:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.70,0:03:37.54,Default,,0,0,0,,“During the time he was searching for Jehovah,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.53,0:03:40.90,Default,,0,0,0,,the true God made him prosper.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.90,0:03:43.87,Default,,0,0,0,,So he started out well; he ruled well.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.87,0:03:48.88,Default,,0,0,0,,He was humble,\Nand Jehovah blessed him for many years.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.88,0:03:51.92,Default,,0,0,0,,But now look over at verse 16,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.92,0:03:55.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and you’ll notice\Nthat it starts out with the word “however.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.52,0:03:58.02,Default,,0,0,0,,And when the Bible uses that word “however,”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.02,0:04:00.52,Default,,0,0,0,,it means something changed.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.52,0:04:05.06,Default,,0,0,0,,“However, as soon as he was strong,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.06,0:04:09.23,Default,,0,0,0,,his heart became haughty to his own ruin.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.23,0:04:11.67,Default,,0,0,0,,And then, as you know, \Nhe even tried to go into the temple
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.67,0:04:13.67,Default,,0,0,0,,and offer incense.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.67,0:04:16.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what does that mean,\N‘he became strong’?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.07,0:04:18.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the Insight book explains
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.07,0:04:21.94,Default,,0,0,0,,that he\N“became famous for his military successes.”
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.95,0:04:25.49,Default,,0,0,0,,So apparently these successes,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.48,0:04:28.18,Default,,0,0,0,,these achievements, went to his head
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.18,0:04:30.68,Default,,0,0,0,,to the point that he thought\Nhe could go into the temple
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.69,0:04:33.19,Default,,0,0,0,,and usurp the duties of a priest.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.19,0:04:37.33,Default,,0,0,0,,He forgot that Jehovah\Ngave him those victories.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.33,0:04:39.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, that’s a lesson for us, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.33,0:04:43.00,Default,,0,0,0,,If we happen to achieve\Nsuccess in some endeavor,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.00,0:04:47.10,Default,,0,0,0,,may we never forget\Nthat the qualities and abilities
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.10,0:04:50.34,Default,,0,0,0,,that enable us to achieve that success
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.34,0:04:52.91,Default,,0,0,0,,came from Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.91,0:04:56.81,Default,,0,0,0,,But now let’s get\Nour third humility-testing situation:
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.81,0:04:59.41,Default,,0,0,0,,when we’re given counsel.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.42,0:05:03.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, Uzziah also well illustrates this point.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.89,0:05:08.90,Default,,0,0,0,,If you still have your Bible\Nopen there, in verses 17 and 18,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.89,0:05:12.63,Default,,0,0,0,,when Uzziah went\Ninto the temple to offer the incense,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.63,0:05:17.57,Default,,0,0,0,,you notice that it\Ndescribes how ‘Azariah the priest
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.57,0:05:22.21,Default,,0,0,0,,‘and 80 other [and notice, it calls them]\Ncourageous priests
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.21,0:05:24.21,Default,,0,0,0,,went in there after him.’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.21,0:05:26.21,Default,,0,0,0,,They confronted him.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.21,0:05:28.91,Default,,0,0,0,,They tried to give him counsel:\N‘You’re out of order.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.91,0:05:32.45,Default,,0,0,0,,‘What you’re trying to do,\Nonly priests are to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.45,0:05:35.72,Default,,0,0,0,,You’d better go out of this sanctuary.’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.72,0:05:38.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, they tried to give him counsel,\Ndidn’t they?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.62,0:05:41.22,Default,,0,0,0,,But how did Uzziah react?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.22,0:05:44.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, verse 19 tells us
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.06,0:05:47.20,Default,,0,0,0,,that he “became enraged” at them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.20,0:05:50.37,Default,,0,0,0,,‘Who are you to tell me what to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.37,0:05:52.41,Default,,0,0,0,,I’m the king.’
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.40,0:05:55.87,Default,,0,0,0,,His pride became even bigger,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.87,0:05:58.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and Jehovah struck him with leprosy.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.81,0:06:01.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Now think about this:\NJehovah didn’t strike him
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.48,0:06:04.62,Default,,0,0,0,,when he presumptuously first went\Ninto the temple.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.61,0:06:08.75,Default,,0,0,0,,But only when he\Npridefully rejected the counsel,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.75,0:06:11.05,Default,,0,0,0,,then Jehovah struck him.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.05,0:06:13.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, that’s a good lesson for us, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.06,0:06:16.50,Default,,0,0,0,,We have to be very careful\Nthat we never become prideful
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.49,0:06:18.49,Default,,0,0,0,,when we receive counsel.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.49,0:06:21.33,Default,,0,0,0,,And especially do we have to be on guard
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.33,0:06:25.40,Default,,0,0,0,,if we think we have\Nmore authority, perhaps more experience,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.40,0:06:29.04,Default,,0,0,0,,or more seniority\Nthan the one giving us the counsel.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.04,0:06:33.31,Default,,0,0,0,,Let’s get our fourth humility-testing situation:
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.31,0:06:37.98,Default,,0,0,0,,if we happen to come into material prosperity.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.98,0:06:42.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe we get an inheritance,\Nor somehow we come into material prosperity.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.52,0:06:45.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, what happened to the Israelites
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.02,0:06:48.32,Default,,0,0,0,,when they entered\Nthe “land flowing with milk and honey”?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.32,0:06:53.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, the Bible tells us,\Nand Jehovah is speaking at Hosea 13:6.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.26,0:06:56.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah says:\N“They were satisfied with their pastures,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.47,0:06:58.54,Default,,0,0,0,,“they were satisfied
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.53,0:07:02.03,Default,,0,0,0,,“and their heart became proud.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.04,0:07:04.41,Default,,0,0,0,,And so they forgot me.”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.41,0:07:06.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, that’s a sobering lesson, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.78,0:07:09.85,Default,,0,0,0,,If we happen to come into material prosperity,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.85,0:07:13.02,Default,,0,0,0,,we never want to allow that situation
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.02,0:07:15.16,Default,,0,0,0,,to cause us to lose our humility
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.15,0:07:18.79,Default,,0,0,0,,—no matter what our material situation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.79,0:07:23.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Then we\Nmust always humbly depend upon Jehovah
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.79,0:07:25.99,Default,,0,0,0,,and not material things.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.83,0:07:31.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, let’s get our fifth, \Nour last one, humility-testing situation
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.60,0:07:36.07,Default,,0,0,0,,(and it was talked about earlier\Nby one of our commenters):
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.07,0:07:38.54,Default,,0,0,0,,when we receive praise.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.54,0:07:41.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you recall the account in Acts chapter 12
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.98,0:07:45.75,Default,,0,0,0,,when Herod put on his royal raiment,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.75,0:07:48.35,Default,,0,0,0,,he sat down on the judgment seat,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.35,0:07:51.89,Default,,0,0,0,,he began to give a public discourse,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.89,0:07:53.93,Default,,0,0,0,,and the people shouted:
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.92,0:07:58.16,Default,,0,0,0,,“A god’s voice, and not a man’s [voice]”?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.16,0:08:00.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, what happened?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.16,0:08:02.96,Default,,0,0,0,,An angel struck him dead;
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.97,0:08:05.61,Default,,0,0,0,,he died; worms ate him up.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.60,0:08:07.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.07,0:08:10.27,Default,,0,0,0,,Because he didn’t give glory to Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.27,0:08:14.17,Default,,0,0,0,,In stark contrast,\Nthink about the account in Luke 18
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.18,0:08:18.92,Default,,0,0,0,,when a ruler came up to Jesus\Nand called him “Good Teacher,”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.92,0:08:22.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and Jesus said:\N“Why do you call me good?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.45,0:08:25.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Nobody is good except one, God.”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.62,0:08:28.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we can learn\Nfrom those examples, can’t we?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.82,0:08:32.49,Default,,0,0,0,,When we receive praise,\Nthere are two ways we can react:
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.50,0:08:36.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Like Herod,\Ntry to take the credit for ourselves;
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.43,0:08:40.20,Default,,0,0,0,,or like Jesus,\Nwe can give the credit to Jehovah.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.20,0:08:44.37,Default,,0,0,0,,We can do that in words\Nor at least in our heart.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.37,0:08:48.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, Proverbs 27:21 says:
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.08,0:08:52.65,Default,,0,0,0,,“A person is tested by the praise he receives.”
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.65,0:08:56.05,Default,,0,0,0,,And one way he’s tested\Nis when his humility is tested.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.05,0:08:58.82,Default,,0,0,0,,The Watchtower some years ago said this:
