Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.92,0:04:27.92,Default,,0,0,0,,So the psalmist is saying, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.52,0:04:33.62,Default,,0,0,0,,And so when a person says to Jehovah, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.99,0:04:39.20,Default,,0,0,0,,it’s treachery. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.54,0:04:48.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So it adds weight, doesn’t it, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.60,0:04:51.44,Default,,0,0,0,,to our desire never to fall victim \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.44,0:04:55.04,Default,,0,0,0,,to idolatry in any form?\N
