Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.26,0:00:08.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe a better question would be, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.43,0:00:13.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you remember \Nthe last bad decision that you made? \N

Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.71,0:00:33.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, maybe that was a bad decision.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.28,0:00:36.85,Default,,0,0,0,,But some decisions \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.85,0:00:40.26,Default,,0,0,0,,impact our sacred service \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.26,0:00:44.06,Default,,0,0,0,,and our relationship with Jehovah, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.06,0:00:47.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and that’s highlighted in today’s text. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.40,0:00:49.73,Default,,0,0,0,,When viewed in their context, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.73,0:00:53.47,Default,,0,0,0,,we quickly discern \Nthat the words of today’s text \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.47,0:00:56.81,Default,,0,0,0,,were not given as commendation \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.81,0:00:59.54,Default,,0,0,0,,or even as reassurance \N
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:03.91,Default,,0,0,0,,but were given \Nin the context of corrective counsel. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.91,0:01:06.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, who was being counseled? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.68,0:01:08.89,Default,,0,0,0,,King Asa, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.89,0:01:12.99,Default,,0,0,0,,the great-great-grandson of King David, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.99,0:01:17.26,Default,,0,0,0,,the third king of the kingdom of Judah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.26,0:01:20.20,Default,,0,0,0,,He ruled for 41 years, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.20,0:01:23.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and he has the distinction of being known \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.23,0:01:27.74,Default,,0,0,0,,as one of the faithful kings of Judah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.74,0:01:32.21,Default,,0,0,0,,So with that in mind, \Nthe question arises, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.21,0:01:38.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Why would a faithful king \Nneed corrective counsel? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.25,0:01:41.22,Default,,0,0,0,,To answer the question, \Nlet’s turn in our Bibles \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.22,0:01:44.89,Default,,0,0,0,,to 2 Chronicles 16:7: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.89,0:01:47.96,Default,,0,0,0,,“At that time Hanani the seer \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.96,0:01:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“came to King Asa of Judah \Nand said to him: \N
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.50,0:01:57.50,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘Because you relied on the king of Syria \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.51,0:02:07.51,Default,,0,0,0,,so there was the bottom line\N—the root of the problem, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.51,0:02:12.52,Default,,0,0,0,,“‘the army of the king of Syria \Nhas escaped out of your hand.’” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.52,0:02:16.45,Default,,0,0,0,,And then Hanani reminds Asa \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.45,0:02:19.79,Default,,0,0,0,,of an earlier event. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.79,0:02:23.63,Default,,0,0,0,,He asks: \N“Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans \N

Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.30,0:02:31.73,Default,,0,0,0,,“But because you relied on Jehovah, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.73,0:02:34.50,Default,,0,0,0,,he gave them into your hand.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.50,0:02:38.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, sometime earlier, \NAsa and the nation of Judah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.54,0:02:43.08,Default,,0,0,0,,were confronted \Nby Zerah the Ethiopian \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.08,0:02:46.85,Default,,0,0,0,,and 1,000,000 troops. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.85,0:02:51.55,Default,,0,0,0,,How did Asa handle that crisis? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.55,0:02:56.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, he humbly prayed to Jehovah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.06,0:02:59.36,Default,,0,0,0,,and put himself and the nation \Nin Jehovah’s hands. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.36,0:03:03.10,Default,,0,0,0,,And Jehovah was favorably impressed \Nwith that approach, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.10,0:03:07.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and he gave Judah the victory.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.20,0:03:13.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, in this case, \Nwhen King Baasha came against Judah, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.21,0:03:16.41,Default,,0,0,0,,rather than relying on Jehovah, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.41,0:03:21.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Asa bribed Ben-hadad. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.22,0:03:24.35,Default,,0,0,0,,So it was Baasha who came from Israel. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.35,0:03:27.09,Default,,0,0,0,,He bribed King Ben-hadad, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.09,0:03:29.69,Default,,0,0,0,,and it seemed to be successful. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.69,0:03:32.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Ben-hadad came against Baasha; \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.06,0:03:34.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Baasha withdrew from Judah. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.20,0:03:36.90,Default,,0,0,0,,All was well\N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.90,0:03:40.74,Default,,0,0,0,,—except that Jehovah wasn’t pleased. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.74,0:03:45.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Asa left Jehovah out of the equation. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.64,0:03:50.65,Default,,0,0,0,,So with that in mind, \Nin verse 9 we have the counsel, don’t we? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.65,0:03:54.42,Default,,0,0,0,,“For the eyes of Jehovah \Nare roving about through all the earth \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.90,0:04:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So there was the reminder and the counsel.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.57,0:04:17.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Why when confronted with 1,000,000 \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.57,0:04:20.91,Default,,0,0,0,,did Asa depend on Jehovah? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.91,0:04:24.88,Default,,0,0,0,,But when confronted by King Baasha of Israel, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.88,0:04:27.82,Default,,0,0,0,,he depended on himself. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.82,0:04:31.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Isn’t it true that when we face a situation\N—a problem—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.85,0:04:34.19,Default,,0,0,0,,and a decision must be made \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.19,0:04:38.19,Default,,0,0,0,,but the situation \Nis so much bigger than we are, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.19,0:04:40.43,Default,,0,0,0,,we turn to Jehovah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.43,0:04:42.47,Default,,0,0,0,,and we beg for his help \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.10,0:04:48.84,Default,,0,0,0,,It may be a catastrophic illness \N

Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.51,0:04:56.45,Default,,0,0,0,,It could be the death \Nof someone close to us. \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.76,0:05:12.23,Default,,0,0,0,,But other decisions may seem \Nto be more within our grasp\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.23,0:05:16.17,Default,,0,0,0,,—for example, \Nthe selection of a marriage mate \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.60,0:05:24.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe we came to work here. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.17,0:05:26.51,Default,,0,0,0,,And to help with construction, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.51,0:05:29.61,Default,,0,0,0,,we might have sold \Nour home and cut our ties. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.61,0:05:33.45,Default,,0,0,0,,And now a project is nearing completion, \N

Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.83,0:05:50.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Can we pioneer? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.00,0:05:52.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Should we stay in this country? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.74,0:05:57.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Is it possible \Nwe could move to another country?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.67,0:06:01.68,Default,,0,0,0,,If we’re not careful \Nas we make these decisions, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.68,0:06:06.35,Default,,0,0,0,,we could leave Jehovah \Nout of the equation. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.35,0:06:08.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So here’s a question, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.68,0:06:13.36,Default,,0,0,0,,How do we include Jehovah in the equation? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.36,0:06:16.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, there are three things that we can do. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.76,0:06:19.26,Default,,0,0,0,,The first is research. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.26,0:06:22.77,Default,,0,0,0,,What does Jehovah tell us in his Word \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.77,0:06:27.37,Default,,0,0,0,,that has application \Nto the situation we’re facing? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.37,0:06:30.84,Default,,0,0,0,,What has “the faithful and discreet slave” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.84,0:06:33.54,Default,,0,0,0,,told us in the publications? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.54,0:06:37.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Has there been an article or some direction \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.25,0:06:40.25,Default,,0,0,0,,that would be helpful to us?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.25,0:06:45.02,Default,,0,0,0,,A second ingredient is that of prayer, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.02,0:06:49.43,Default,,0,0,0,,talking with Jehovah \Nabout the decision that we’re making. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.43,0:06:51.83,Default,,0,0,0,,And keeping in mind that we don’t expect \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.83,0:06:55.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Jehovah to do our thinking for us, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.16,0:06:58.90,Default,,0,0,0,,but he will help us and direct us \N
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.90,0:07:02.64,Default,,0,0,0,,so that we can make a good decision.\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.64,0:07:06.54,Default,,0,0,0,,And finally, \Nhere in the Bethel setting \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.54,0:07:08.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and in the congregations, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.54,0:07:13.48,Default,,0,0,0,,we have a wealth \Nof experienced, faithful brothers and sisters \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.48,0:07:17.12,Default,,0,0,0,,who would be more than happy \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.12,0:07:22.16,Default,,0,0,0,,to help us benefit \Nfrom their experience in life. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.16,0:07:24.76,Default,,0,0,0,,So if we do these three things\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.76,0:07:27.43,Default,,0,0,0,,—our research, prayer, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.43,0:07:31.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and talk with experienced, faithful ones—\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.23,0:07:34.50,Default,,0,0,0,,then we can make a good decision. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.50,0:07:36.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, here’s the question, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.71,0:07:40.04,Default,,0,0,0,,What is a good decision? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.04,0:07:43.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Wouldn’t you agree \Nthat ultimately a good decision \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.85,0:07:46.68,Default,,0,0,0,,is one that Jehovah can bless? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.68,0:07:49.42,Default,,0,0,0,,And often we have a number of options, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.42,0:07:52.19,Default,,0,0,0,,and it’s not necessarily a question \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.19,0:07:55.63,Default,,0,0,0,,of making a wrong or right decision\N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.63,0:07:57.63,Default,,0,0,0,,—but what decision. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.63,0:08:01.86,Default,,0,0,0,,What can we do that will enhance \Nour relationship with Jehovah \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.86,0:08:05.03,Default,,0,0,0,,and give him something to bless?\N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.03,0:08:08.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, there’s one other point in the account \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.47,0:08:11.14,Default,,0,0,0,,that can be very encouraging to us. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.14,0:08:14.98,Default,,0,0,0,,If you look back at 2 Chronicles 15 \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.98,0:08:20.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and the “b” portion of verse 17. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.02,0:08:24.39,Default,,0,0,0,,It says: \N“Nevertheless, Asa’s heart \N

Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.72,0:08:31.09,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s interesting, isn’t it? \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.09,0:08:33.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, in our text for today, \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.23,0:08:35.30,Default,,0,0,0,,we’re told that Jehovah is searching \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.30,0:08:39.67,Default,,0,0,0,,for “those whose heart \Nis complete toward him.” \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.67,0:08:42.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Ultimately, Jehovah viewed Asa \N

Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.21,0:08:50.58,Default,,0,0,0,,It’s comforting to know \Nthat Jehovah did not measure the man \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.58,0:08:54.02,Default,,0,0,0,,because of one faulty decision; \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.02,0:08:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,He looked at the whole picture. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.52,0:08:59.46,Default,,0,0,0,,And evidently, Asa’s good qualities \N
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.46,0:09:01.82,Default,,0,0,0,,and his zeal for pure worship \N
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.82,0:09:06.83,Default,,0,0,0,,outweighed the bad decision \Nthat he made in this case. \N
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.83,0:09:08.83,Default,,0,0,0,,So when we make bad decisions\N
